1,DINESH,Average product.,"Last few months I am using this mobile performance wise not bad, if you download any file you can't find where it saved.Display -ok not full HD,Audio- Low
Speed - you can't play any online games it will be very slow. Earphone -not available.
Cam-Good, Totally it is an average product, you can use for only calls and watching movies, Phone contains fiber body, we have to handle carefully.",11 March 2019,3
2,Ritvik Rai,Best battery. Beautiful Specs and Display. Love the phone.,"I just picked up an amazing phone which is Samsung m30 and I'm so happy to make the right decision.
Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I can strem all my favourite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128gb varient.
The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)",11 March 2019,5

4,Aman Darji,Review about the beast!! The Samsung Galaxy M30,"A Samsung's new launched M30 Smart phone is very cool because of the Infinity U AMOLED Fhd + Display is looking very nice. 13 MP ultra - wide dual camera & a triple camera setup capture which is clearly so cool with one of the best photography & great selfies. One of best part is that the battery lasts long since it has massive 5000 mAh battery & also 3x Fast Charge. Storage its also an important factor. It has 4GB RAM | 64GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB, it means you have sufficient space where you can downlod videos, movies, songs and data. Next is, it has Dual SIM slots and a dedicated slot for memory card.

5,Aidan Dsilva,Awesome Buy,"Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone. I love it",11 March 2019,5

8,Aakash Kaushal,Samsung is back !,"Bought it in the 1st sale. Using for 3rd day now and what i feel is ..
Elegant looks.
Display quality is brilliant.
Cameras are lovely. And charging speed is great thanks to inbox 15w charger. For a average regular user having not much interest of playing games I would definitely recommend this. Moreover, design is literally premium and and finally Brand is Samsung 😀",11 March 2019,5
9,Bittu,An Amazing Device - True Value For Money ! 👌,"I was lucky enough to get this Amazing device in the very first sale on 7th March and that too my desirable variant ! 😊 The delivery was also fast. Thanks to Amazon ! 👍
The phone is definitely a True Value For Money as it offers great specs along with great features with an attractive price tag. Let me organise my views about this amazing phone as follows...

LOOKS : 🔎📲👍
The mobile is definitely an eye-catcher due to its Premium finish, Slim body, Bezel less screen and the Double shaded back panel (I got a Gradation Blue Variant for me !)
The volume and power buttons are placed rightly and are easy to access.

CAMERA : 📸 👍
It has 16 MP + 3 MP + 3MP Triple camera which captures Amazing shots !
With 7 different modes, you can choose the best one according to the scene being clicked. There's a button for Wide Angle which instantly widens the scene to be captured. I have attached the shots of the ceiling with and without Wide Angle Mode. Besides, the stickers and beauty modes work superb to get attractive selfie too.

DISPLAY : 📱👍
6.4 inch Super AMOLED display is brilliant and a small U shaped notch adds to the attraction of its infinity display... The touch and interface is super smooth too and the brightness level is very efficient. You don't need to set it to full brightness when you are outside even in the afternoon.

MULTI TASKING : 📚👍
With it's huge 6GB RAM and 128GB Storage, it's very easy to perform as many tasks as you want without any lag. The phone performs flawlessly without any lag or heating. You can activate Pop up window setting and it will make your Multi Tasking lot more easy and interesting too.

BATTERY : 🔋🤔
Battery sure is a huge one, i.e.5000mAh, but I didn't feel it sufficient enough to last for 24 hours even. Maybe, it's due to network issues or maybe I have to watch it again after some more charge cycles.
Though, Fast charging from it's 15 watt charger (type C port) is indeed capable of charging the phone really fast.

EXTRAS : 📝
Besides all those stated above, I would like to add some more bullet points...
👍
🔹The Face recognition works great ! There's a lighting animation around the front camera while it tries to identity your face. Looks nice.
🔹 Fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive. You can activate a setting after which you can scroll down the notification tray by sliding your finger on the Fingerprint sensor only !
🔹 The audio quality of the speaker and the earpiece is good. Though, I felt it a bit low when I recorded my voice on star maker app.
🔹 Has dedicated slots for 2 Sims and 1 Memory card.
🔹 Packed with all the needed sensors.

👎
🔹I found no option of assigning a SIM to a specific contact.
🔹 The back panel is plastic and it's kind of finger print magnet.
🔹 The Do Not Disturb function doesn't mute the phone completely though it says so. Instead, I click on the Speaker icon to mute in notification tray.
🔹 No Gorilla glass protection for the display.
🔹 It's not water resistant.
🔹 It doesn't have an Always On Display.
🔹 No Slow Motion video recording feature.
🔹 Runs on Android 8.1. Don't know when will it get the Pie update.

Overall, I feel it is an Amazing phone in this price and I am very satisfied with it's overall performance. It completely justifies it's price. I would strongly recommend this device to everyone looking for a Superb mobile in a moderate budget. Go for it and Thank me later ! 😊",15 March 2019,5
10,Vishwa Shah,Impressed,"Vishwa Shah M30 - 4+64 It's really amazing,the phone looks great the features are up to the mark .it has got everything which someone would want in a phone, really loved it ...also the picture quality is way too good and the sound effect as well.
The phone is speedy and the battery lasts longer too.
It is also very easy to use and equally easy to carry and handle and looks pretty cool it has got every possible required features and I will highly recommend people to go for this amazingly great phone
Samsung has actually done a great job,thank you!!! Y'all wouldn't regret buying this phone and it is so affordable.",11 March 2019,5
11,Durga prasad,Not working properly,Charging is not getting done. Once switch on the mobile. Within 1 minute charging getting 0 and switch off. When switch on again its showing 70% and same getting switch off. Not getting charging while mobile is on,22 March 2019,1
12,Nitish Singh,A great phone for an non-gamer,"First things first,
The phone is not for everyone. You may be thinking you should get a gaming phone at this price. But it is not.
However, the good news is that there are other good phones in this price range if you are looking for a gaming device and especially looking to buy it for playing PUBG. Trust me, do not buy this phone if you are into gaming.

So, who should buy the device? Any non-gamer user who loves other aspects of the phone such as a display, battery, camera and so on.

Display
The display is the most stunning feature of the Samsung M30. It is vibrant and simply stands out. I compared it with my POCO F1 and found it more vibrant, clear and with a punchy contrast. But that doesn't mean POCO F1 display is bad. At 15K, you are getting one heck of a deal when it comes to the display.

Another thing that I noticed is the great body to screen ration. It almost covers the whole screen.

Processor and RAM
As we said earlier, the processor is not up to mark when it comes to running heavy apps such as games. But for an average user like me and you, who love to do calls, read messages and run the basic application, the phone will be more than enough. It will not go slow while using the available RAM(4GB in my case).

Battery
5000mAh battery is super awesome! It is another selling point for the phone. If you are looking for a big battery then the phone is for you. Also, the processor and OS are optimized for each other which makes the battery last longer.

Camera
I didn't test camera that much. But, it does look nice. You can take nice photos. But the camera does not perform best in low light conditions which is okay for a phone priced at 15K.

OS
I tried Samsung OS for the first time. I found it pretty decent, but not outstanding. You need to navigate multiple times for basic features. But, the good thing is that the UI will help you navigate and you will eventually find the option that you are looking for.

In short
Display: One of the best
Battery: 5000mAh, more than enough for heavy one day use. Can easily last two days for normal users.
Processor + RAM: Great for normal users, not great for gamers.
OS: Decent

Overall rating: 8.5/10",13 March 2019,4
13,Rajesh Manjrekar,Awesome phone... Loved it!!!!!,"This is the best phone i found at this price range. I just loved it. It is super fast and the screen is just beautiful thanks to the Amoled fhd display. The fast charging charges the phone in no time. More ever the 5000 mah battery is a just incredible at the end of day i have around 30% juice remaining!!!! For a pubg lover like me... All i can say is the phone is very very smooth no lags, no frame drops and the big screen gives the best experience 😍. I also liked the front camera which clicks amazing selfies coming to the back camera its just Lit!! The photos look real and natural colours are preserved as well. All i can say is its a stunning phone worth the price.... Loved it!!!",13 March 2019,5
14,Ankur,Value for money - A truly practical phone,"I have chosen this product over other mobiles in this price range for below reasons :
1. Big battery(5000mah -others have only 4000mah)
2. Triple card slot(believe me this matters though we tend to ignore this point but for those who use double sim ... we would definitely need to use both sims and one memory chip)
3. Super amoled display (again other mobiles simply don't have it)
4. Fast charging + fast charger in-the- box
5. Wide angle camera- useful for big family photos
6. Samsung trust factor

Now after using our fire two full days below are pros and cons I found :

Pros:
---------
1. Battery - Simply awesome. I first charged it yesterday 9.30 AM (100%). Since I did below tasks throughout yesterday and today and it went to 10% today at 6.44 PM ( so 1 day & 9 hrs) :
▪ Audio calls
▪ video calls
▪ internet browsing
▪ listening to songs (headphone and speaker both)
▪ watching movie (Netflix) and YouTube
▪ setting up phone( usual setting for a new phone - so basically screen was on)
▪ playing games( asphalt 9, dead target, fruit ninja) - all games ran without single stutter

2. Screen- simply beautiful
Being amoled display it show very deep colours which u won't see in normal fhd lcd/tft displays.

As soon as u will see other mobiles without amoled u will notice the difference.
3. UI is smooth and gestures are nice.
4. Always on display gives our result premium look ( though our drains battery faster)
5. Headphone quality is very nice
6. Call quality is also very nice( the most important feature of any phone but we least bother about it nowadays 😉)
7. Charging time nice for 5000 mah battery- 2.15 hrs >> 10% to 100%)
8. Camera is decent (not the best int this price range)

Cons:
---------
1. Processor works fine though but i felt slight stutters here n there (but fortunately it worked really nice for three games i played as mentioned above)
2. Camera doesn't perform well in low light conditions) [but works great in day light]

Till now i m seriously enjoying using this phone even people in my office are appreciating our thanks to its stunning display.

For me its truly practical phone for my requirement as I m not a serious gamer but i will post updated review on 18th before its next sale on 19th so that u can decide if this phone is for you or not",16 March 2019,5
15,Shanu siddiqui,Bad product,It's just the 3rd day and proximity sensor is not working in this device and ear piece is heating up while on call. Phone is slow and not a right choice for 15k. Please consider other brand products this phone is not good for regular usage as well.,13 March 2019,1
16,rakesh,Dont purchase this phone it is worst for money,"I am giving 1 star for Amazon service and 2 star for this phone camera quality is not better and I used two days heating problem comes. If you buy this phone from Amazon then it will not be replaceable and returned because a smart check app made for phone performance checking, it always shows right in all parameters. In this way you won't be able to replace / return this phone. So I suggest Dont purchase this phone Samsung Galaxy M30 from Amazon if it defective found it won't be replaced",15 March 2019,1
17,MIR,Don't buy any Samsung phone with exynos processor..,Good looking fone nice display asusual from Samsung I loved Samsung phone but now since they start using there exynos processors in there fones there phones have become a crap..till note 2 everything was fine..but after note 2 I bought j7 2016 it had network issues then finally I sold it for peanuts..then I didn't buy Samsung for a year I used other brands and was happy with there performance..but as I said I always liked Samsung Mobile..so I thought to give one more try to newly launched Samsung m30 I bought it on first day sale..but to shock me it had same networks issues as I had with j7 2016..very slow internet like 2G speed ..so I was sure its again same exynos processor problem..so called the Amazon cor the same they said technician ll visit to check the phone and technician said the same this phone had hardware problems. It's just I know coz of exynos processor..now they are going to replace it with new one but I have no trust that even second replaced phone ll be working well...as it ll have same issue coz of exynos processor what to do can't get refund..so only can think of I ll have better luck with replaced samsm30..pray for me..speaker quality is cranky worst than an ordinary mobile fone microphone quality is also very poor to the surprise no headphones in the box.. I must admit display is awesome...,16 March 2019,1
18,Mah,Can't turn on! error message,"Custom binary blocked by reactivation..... not sure what the hell is that mean but ""Expert chat in support says "" contact Samsung CCC as if i got plenty spare time to fix your pathetic phone issues.
There is something really wrong! you buy a product and run after solving someone else issues. samsung / customer service OPs. get a life
UPDATE: I am still continuing conversation with customer service for pickup and replacement! THIS IS HORROR",17 March 2019,1
19,Aj,Many people received Manufacturing defect phone..,I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M30 through Amazon flash sale on 19th March and received on 20th March. Upon unboxing I noticed that right corner of phone is bulged out. Now waiting for technician to inspect. I also found many people faced similar issues.,22 March 2019,1
20,Amazon Customer,Over Heating Issue,I just purchased this model. It has an overheating issue even during browsing and if we play PubG that time it's too much overheated. Battery Draining issue does not seem like 5000 mah battery till evening only 40% battery remaining. In this model Samsung remove Secure Folder option so we can not hide personal data.,13 March 2019,2
21,kavin,Camera problem & Rude customer care," Got a faulty Samsung M30 phone.

After two weeks of using found that the camera stopped working.

Camera Issue:
When we click on camera icon blank screen is coming.

Lag issue:
Sometimes on touching on any icon an evident delay is happening.

With all these issues reported given to service center

Things done in service center:
- Updated OS
- Replaced camera
Still the issue is not fixed.

Now they told they will replaced the panel and check. Still haven't found any problem. When requested for replacement with all these valid problems not replacing the faulty phone.

Very rude people working for Samsung customer care. Worst experience with that also.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Attached video of those problems. Please refer it... Can attach only one video

New Update:
Finally they have replaced the board and the problem was fixed...

And they gave me 6 months extended warranty.

Though didn't get a device replacement.",14 April 2019,1

23,Urmi Bhatt,Best phone in this price,"When it comes to Samsung M30, you know you're in a good deal. From the display to the look of it, I love every single bit of it. The blue gradient color is one to look out of for. When it comes to using it, you have a power packed device in your hand. Powered with Android 8.1, it is the latest one in the market making it already a favourite. When it comes to RAM, it handles it all. The camera is pretty impressive and the display is an infinite making it amazing to view at. The battery life on the other hand, is long enough letting you do whatever you want to. Even if the battery is low, it charges up extremely fast enough to enjoy your phone once again. The fast charger is a unique and a must have one. The camera has all the settings of that a professional camera, making it an amazing option to have. I highly recommend this for all students",11 March 2019,5
24,Alvin,Great at first. Not anymore.,"Great screen and battery backup Impressed me. Pubg worked well in medium. Camera looked good and all.....the next day,it worked for seconds and the screen died while using it. No external damage. Just went black,and touch was still working. Worse customer service but finally got my refund (replacement wasn't even available) today. It also has a crap processor. It lagged when switching apps. Go for note 7 pro,way better buy than this.",13 March 2019,1
25,Sameksh,Money worth spending,"Samsung galaxy M30 is the lowest priced smart phone with 3 back cameras.It has a 16mp front camera with focus which is seen very less in any smartphone below 18,000 INR M30 also gives a 5000 MaH battery so we get a better battery back up and use the phone all day without any need to charge.Phone comes with a amoled display so the contrast and the characters are really sharp and the screen looks really beautiful.The 6gb ram and 128GB RAM will make your phone run faster than ever you can play any game in your phone so your gaming experience is going to be really good and The phone is really light you wont even feel any weight on your pockets when you roam around and looks of the phone is mind blowing overall Samsung galaxy M30 is a delight to have in your hands If your budget is under 20000 it is your go to phone",11 March 2019,5

27,Ram g,Worst Product from Samsung,"Unboxed the item and tried to play ringtone or any song to check Audio quality. External speaker is not working . Performed Soft reset and Hard reset both. Now the device become abnormal state during booting stage and is rebooting automatically for more than 30 mins by showing ""SAMSUNG GALAXY M30"" nothing given over control to move forward...Hold power button on time to control above situation but no use. Is started working like as Un programmed ROBOT.
Not at all expected from SAMSUNG.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Are you guys are checking\testing products properly before dispatching to the customers ?? (or) for flash sale sake running behind ???? thinking like Let first deliver and make money, later on will respond to the customers if they face any problem with the defective piece. .
Irony is for this product especially, customer will not get an option to select replacement or refund option . You have to be dependent on customer care executive for any further support.You will not come to know the status immediately though executive raised a request for Replacement. It take some time to reflect in the system to update after going through several approvals process. I.e replacement / Refund is not hassle free process.",22 March 2019,1
28,Darshan Doshi,Samsung M30,So yeah talking about samsung M30 its just amazing with new classic look you can say the phone is of next generation and pretty amazing with its features. Talking about camera who needs digital camera if you have samsung M30 who need play station when you have this M30 with its amazing gaming mode and talking about selfie features such a zoom out selfie is lit portrait and and many others like it has all in one we can say a complete phone talking about processor of the phone its ultra amazing one can play games without getting hang amazing touch like its just sleek and smooth 3 cameras back and 1 in front amazing like its catches your personality cool battery life so amazing like we charged for minutes and hold it for 2 days continuous battery life talking about price of phone it is very structural and affordable for every middle class person so that even they can also have phone with all the banging features even slow mode and video mode is very unique coming to the body of the phone gradient colour is very mesmerising battery life is super ultimate i would say its very powerful and I’ll surely recommend my friends to go for it.,11 March 2019,5

30,AJN,50-50 experience in comparison to other phones in same segment.,"Loving the m30. Super light and easy to hold thanks to its curved design. Sometimes the screen gets a little cut off at the corners but that's okay. Great customisation. Battery is pretty great. Love that the headphone Jack and the charging point is on the same end and that it has a dedicated slot. Finger print scanner and face detection is a little dull. Can't lock my phone with finger print like I could on my Moto G5s+. Also the speaker kinda resounds, as though you were in a closed room. Also camera is pretty average, hating the beauty mode. Touch sensitivity can also be a little awkward sometimes in the corners. All in all it's a decent phone, great battery life so for basic users who don't play games sometimes or all the time. It's a great handset to have invested in. However, it suits my basic needs, so I'm all for it.",14 March 2019,4

34,ravi kumar,Poor build quality... ☹,Phone specifications are awesome but it's build quality is too poor. It's rare is scratched in only one day normal use . Im disappointed with it.,11 March 2019,2
35,Dinesh Chaurasia,M30 Battery is worst and overall quality is not good,"After 4months using of this mobiles set, I am writing my this feedback. Samsung M30 processing is slow, it's finger print senser and face detection features are not upto the mark. Its Battery which is 5000AmH, does not seem powerful battery, it's performance is equal to 2800-3000AmH battery, it get s drained very fast watching videos. If you charge its battery 100% then it comes down 97% within 30 minutes without using the phone.
Camera quality is also not good, there is no sense of rear triple camera.
This is only Brand Tag Samsung but over all quality of this phone is not good. It is not worthwhile to o spend Rs 15000 for this ""GHATIYA"" mobile.
So if somebody wants to buy M30, don't buy it. Better should go for Redmi note 7 pro/ Honor or Vivo",16 March 2019,1
36,Bharath,MUST READ BEFORE BUYING,"The phone is not at all good ....phones that other brands offer in the same price range are fabulous.

The selfies are just super awesome with great quality. 6.4 inch comes with infinity display just loved it.The phone never had lagging issues the games like pubg ran very smoothly✔
The fingerprint sensor also responds with second or less.samsung always comes with the great picture quality also this time the picture quality i love it the triple cameras are just best to capture life's unforgettable moments.
Just a great piece of advice from your brother in this price range there is no other like Samsung. Just go for it 😍😍😍
The M30 and M series are just killing it great price ,great specs,quality,and the brand Samsung just loved it ✋😍✔""",11 March 2019,5
41,Tejas Thakur,Never buy a SAMSUNG PHONE!!!,"THE WORST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER USED!!
Purchased on : April 2, 2019
Received on : April 4, 2019
I actually brought Samsung Galaxy M30 on March 12 (flash sale)... The phone died in just 6 days... The phone didn't turn on again... I requested a replacement for the product, but it was not in stock... So amazon refunded my money on Amazon Pay... I purchased M30 again (on April 2, 2019)... The phone died again just within 2 days!! The screen turned off automatically while I was using it... I tried to turn it on thinking that this might be an accidental switch off... My phone had a charge around 57%... But when I tried to turn on, nothing happened... I plugged a charger into it, it just showed a circle with a lighting symbol (⚡) in it... The same thing had happened with my first M30... Now I've requested for a refund from amazon... I trusted Samsung a lot... But it BROKE MY TRUST WITHIN BLINKS!!! NEVER BUY A SAMSUNG PHONE!!!",7 April 2019,1

The camera is not as expect.",13 March 2019,4
43,Bedaprakash Singhsamant,not a value for its price.,"Received it today.firstly the screen and display is great but the polycarbonate body looks real cheap for this price range.
Checked through the settings and apps.well you will not find any lag for now.I believe thats same for all smart phones at this range.
Guys dont go for this phone if you are camera savvy, its not the right deal. Although its usp is triple rear camera but its not just that good enough.
Wide angle is superb but colour correction and AI control is no atall upto the mark. Note 7 pro, samsung j30 will be ranked way above these model.
Front camera is ok and take decent photos.
there is a pro mode in camera but not much manual option to p;lay with other that iso and exposure control.
Video mode has literally no features.
just point and shoot.
Atleast expected slowmo and time lapse is 15k budget phone.
Battery is good and fast 15w charger was in the package.",20 March 2019,3

45,Mitesh Tendolkar,More value for money,"Best phone to get rid of those Chinese options. Phone is manufactured in India and comes with a trust of brand Samsung. With M series Samsung have overcome it's all time drawback of not giving powerful battery. Camera and sound quality is excellent. Face recognition is quick. Screen is superb, in any light and at any angle. Feel of phone is solid and doesn't give feel of plastic. Gradient back panel looks awesome.",13 March 2019,5
46,AmazonCustomer,BAD EXPERIENCE,"I am very disappointed with this phone from Samsung M30. I am using it for more 7 days and here is why I am reviewing bad:
- Phone heats up while playing PUBG;
- Display is not good at all. Mi is no doubt way better.
- Battery is 5000mah as they say but does not work like that. Even in week 1, it died very easily. Another reason to give 1 is because Frapp, which asked us to buy this product didn’t pay my stipend earlier. They acted as Fraud company.",24 April 2019,1
47,Avigyan,Beast at a 15k price range,"I'll head straight to my likes and dislikes.

Likes:

1. Massive Battery: The back up is really good. For a regular user, easily a day and half's juice.
2. Fast Charging: Takes about 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 10%. Yes 2 hours is a lot but even the battery is large.
3. Camera: Does a good job. I was on a fix after checking Redmi Note 7 Pro's camera samples, but trust me the shots are equally good, and the front camera does a better job than Redmi's.
4. Customization: The UI has gestures, features and better options for accessibility than the previous generations of Samsung.
5. No stutter/ lag: Using it for 3 days now, and faced no lag. Smooth experience when it comes to daily usage (can't say about gaming)
6: Minimal Heating: Very less heating. Some people have complained about heating during calls. I haven't faced any.
7. Call Clarity: The calls, the major purpose a phone serves are crystal clear, infact a better reception and a loud microphone (Note 7 Pro has issues with microphone, its not too

Dislikes:

1. Ads: Like MI, even this phone shows up ads randomly while using any app. Can be reduced, but can't be escaped from.
2. Speaker Loudness: Satisfactory and decent but not very loud.
3. Face recognition is fast, but not very fast. Also doesn't work at certain angles.
4. Loss of detail in ultra wide camera
5. No dark mode (black/ dark background for UI. I personally like it that way)
6. Android Oreo in box, and no clue when Pie will be rolled out. Newer versions of Android tend to provide better functionality.",22 March 2019,5
48,Vikram S.,Does not support Samsung Knox,"This is a good product, but I want to return it because this does not fulfill my important need.

49,Harsh Marolikar,A Great Phone,"I wanted a budget friendly phone and I was lucky to have found one. Firstly, I was happy that it is a Samsung product which one can rely on. Secondly, it was falling under my budget of 14,990. I can say that I am very thankful for Samsung, for launching such a great phone. This phone has everything that one can ask for , be it good camera, battery, display, processor, be it anything, Samsung M30 fulfills your demand. Personally for me , I am highly impressed with its Battery power, it has 5000mah battery which is amazing. Now a days it is very difficult to get such a great battery life in a phone. It has 4gb RAM , which is one of best feature of this phone as myself being a game addict , i always wished for a phone in which i can enjoy playing games smoothly without lacking and Samsung M30 has made it possible. It has 3 cameras at the Back and one front camera as well which is pretty amazing. It's Infinity U display steals everything, it gives a premium feeling while using the phone. Samsung M30 is the best phone one can ask for. The design of the phone is amazing and I might not switch to some another phone for atleast sometime now.",11 March 2019,5

It has a triple ultra wide camera which adds into its favour as no other phones offer something like this, makes you click amazing photographs which Im sure is a DSLR quality. Also an extra efficient battery of 5000 Mah plus the storing capacity of 128 GB which will help you play all your favourite games, watch high quality videos and you dont even run out of your gallery space.

56,ARPIT URMALIYA,Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint if stretching your budget a bit for Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50," [ ] 8/10 -----design
[ ] 8/10-------display
[ ] 6/10--------software
[ ] 7/10--------performance
[ ] 9/10---------battery life
[ ] 7/10--------camera
[ ] 8/10--------value for money

The Galaxy M30 almost renders the Galaxy M20 redundant. For the extra 2000 bucks, you get an AMOLED screen, better selfies, better connectivity (dual-band Wi-Fi), and a better portrait mode for the rear camera.

When compared to the new and emerging competition like Redmi Note 7 Pro, the Galaxy M30 has its advantages (AMOLED display, HD streaming, software, battery, fast charging) and let downs (performance, primary rear camera, plastic body), but it should still largely bank on the Samsung brand value to win the bout. The Note 7 Pro leads in several key aspects.

If you are not much into high-end gaming, would value display quality over the camera performance, and are restricted by a budget, the Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint. You could also look into stretching your budget a bit for Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50.

(Dear Samsung try to respect the customers and their valuable money don't play trial and error game with us)

I also enquired and found that many phones in Samsung M30 has this issue, this is clearly a trial and error piece from Samsung so that the future upcoming phone they can work on.

Rest of the things like the camera and battery is fine since I am likely to be a tech guy the made a poor design in hardware and it is very unstable.

Pros:
Display:
You are not going to get this elegant display in this price range except M30

Camera: rear camera quality is good but front camera is excellent

Battery:
It would last easily around 2 days if you are normal user. It get full charged in around 1hrs 40 min

Ram management is excellent. You will get around 108gb free out of 128. Built Quality is excellent and dosen't feel like plastic body. but you must buy a case because if you broke display it will be too expensive due to super Amoled display

70,Nicky,Wouldn't recommend to buy. Think twice before buying this mobile.,"Wouldn't recommend to buy. Think twice before buying this mobile.

I am writing this review after using the mobile for more than 20 days. And I regret myself buying this mobile. I had great expectations on this mobile which came from Samsung. But in many aspects it failed to meet the expectations.
I would go with a 3 star for this one.

Cons:
1. The worst part of the mobile is the touch sensitivity. Touch sensitivity is very poor. Sometimes you need to touch the screen at least thrice or more operate the mobile. No one would really want to have such a kind of issue. Don't really understand why Samsung has manufactured such a bad touch sensor. Don't know how to get this issue fixed :(

2. Samsung claims that this mobile comes with fast charging. Believe me, I haven't seen any such difference. I used 4 mobiles from Redmi series till now which didn't have fast charging facility and M30 takes the same time as Redmi to get charged completely.

3. Despite of having 5,000 mah battery, the backup is not that great but manageable (Almost similar to Redmi series)

4. When someone speaks using this mobile, you feel the vibration of voice from the back side (which in general will be observed in low priced speakers).

5. Finger print sensor is not good. The sensor takes time to recognize the finger print. You might need to touch it twice some times.

This mobile is not worth waiting and investing 15K. I am thinking to sell this off. Think twice before buying this mobile. Will try to update my observations after few more days.",19 April 2019,3

The battery easily lasts 1.5 days even with heavy usage. The phone is quite light and feels nice to hold. Samsung's Android skin is nicely done and quite responsive. The only negatives I can think of are the plastic back, but I'm not complaining as the pricing of this phone is very competitive. The other is the bloatware apps that come preinstalled via Iron Source. It's been quite a while I've been so excited about a new phone. Overall a fantastic buy at this price point.",15 March 2019,5

101,rahul nair,A game changing device!,"Samsung has nailed this market segment with the inception of M series of smart phones, my latest pick which is the M30 brings segment best features like Super AMOLED display, Triple cameras, etc. The display is beyond words, this AMOLED display has great contrast, deep blacks, really saturated and popping colours which is the absolute best for consuming media like Netflix, YouTube, etc. And the display is pretty huge too at 6.4 inches but thanks to its minimal bezels and infinity-U notch, the overall footprint is quite handy! The M30 has a giant battery clocking at 5000 mAh which is more than plenty for day and a half's usage and yet the device is reasonably sleek and ergonomic.
And this time around Samsung went with a gradient back which in person looks very appealing. The back of the device also houses THREE cameras! The ultra wide angle lens is again the segment first and is really really convenient. The cameras in general is great with pretty good dynamic range once the HDR is turned on and the selfie camera has a lot of details and again has pretty good dynamic range with great skin tones. Samsung M30 has pretty impressive performance and is exactly why it's plenty fun to play PUBG and other games with heavy graphics, and the device never runs out of steam because of it's 6 gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM. To sum it up, the Samsung Galaxy M30 has the right ingredients for a perfect smart phone for us millennials i.e. exceptional display, humongous battery, splendid cameras and mighty performance for the price that I paid.",11 March 2019,5
102,Jinesh Doshi,THE BEST phone.,"My new Samsung Galaxy M30 hands down feels great overall, but to be more specific I'll point out few great things first and then those points are explained in details.

1. Great experience using AMOLED display.
2. 2 sims with SD card slot.
3. Triple Camera
4. Faster fingerprint and face unlock
5. Type C charging and 5000 mah battery with fast charging and light in weight
Now let me explain these in details,

1. With the AMOLED display looks so good and the while playing games and videos the feel is literally amazing

2. The phone although having a great storage capacity offers you a sd card slot with 2 sim cards.

3. I am really excited to use the new triple Camera setup in the Galaxy M30, with the triple camera. I can even can click great ultra wide shots for boosting up my smartphone photography skills.

4. The fingerprint and face unlock are comparatively faster than some other phones in this price range.

5. The Galaxy M30 houses a massive 5000mah battery that also supports 3X fast charging with type c charging, what more do you want at this price. Also with this big battery in the device it feels quite light weight.",11 March 2019,5

104,Vignesh Krishna,The NO Nonsense phone that fits the bill,"Let's face it...
1.Any phone gets obsolete after minimum 8 months.. And the average time of use may be at least a year and half... If agreed then it is highly suggested to go for the 6 GB 128 GB Storage variant to help your phone be of any relevance.
2.its high time that amazon be serious about making available and suggesting the right and approved accessories as the wrong ones make the phone look cheap (example the quality of temper glass and the suggested case)
3.The adaptive display(auto adjust of brightness according to the environment isn't that adaptive and has a mind of its own.
4.This phone is definitely not a Ahhh...Wow phone and neither a Ohh...no phone.
5.Definitely needs a software and technical updates to utilise the phone to its full potential.
6.Camera is Really good for someone who isn't extremely serious about cameras. Requires a bit of updates too.
7.Sound from speaker could be a teeny tiny notch better but not bad either.
8.Amoled display is extremely good and I'm doubtful that I would downgrade to a lcd display.
9.Phone has 60%Of useful apps inbuilt removing the need to depend on third party apps filled with ads(ex. Antiviral, clone apps, screen power buttons etc)
10.Samsung itself doesn't recommend the dependability on face recognition that much while initiating and neither do I suggest it as an alrnative to good old password or pattern or fingerprint.

Overall...this phone is good for moderate to frequent users and not for extreme dependent users. I'm happy with this purchase and nothing can change that.",25 March 2019,4

The size of the screen and the colour production is so superb it feels so premium especially at the price that I got it. The camera is mind blowing in the triple camera performs a very good job which feels like professional photography but its all captured in my smartphone.

110,Uttam,Guys don't buy these scrap Samsung M series phones.,"3rd Class GPS.
Very very poor network coverage.
Except fingerprint sensor all other sensors are confused all time.
Battery backup is ok.

This phone is not to playing PubG. Because It can't be run with a smooth network.

This review is based on both variants of M30 (4GB + 64GB) and (6GB +128 GB)
Me and my friend order both variants,
And we both are facing these problems, specially GPS and very low network coverage.

When you are in low network area the phone shows Emergency calls only ; whenever at same location other phone with same network operator shows more than 50% network.
And the internet access is also effect with network coverage, that's cause slow internet is irritating.😕

And the sound quality with my senheizer earphones is not good as like other samsung phones.

Guys please don't buy Samsung M series phones.

113,Darshan,New Samsung M30 is best phone,"This smartphone is is easy to use for my daily lifestyle. If you wanna buy a budget phone then this is just perfect. Galaxy M30 is one of the cheapest phones with a triple camera setup. The camera system includes a 13MP primary camera with f/1.9 aperture, a 5MP wide-angle camera and another 5MP camera for depth sensing. On the front, the Galaxy M30 gets a 16MP front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture. The handset ships with Android 8.1 Oreo with Samsung's Experience UI 9.5 on top. The M30 supports dual Nano SIM cards with support for Dual 4G standby.The Galaxy M30 sports a large 6.4-inch Super AMOLED FHD+ (2340x1080) display. Samsung is using its Infinity-U panel for the Galaxy M30, which offers a U-shaped waterdrop notch on the top of the display to house the selfie camera. The Galaxy M30 comes with a plastic rear panel in gradient colours. It also sees a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and vertical triple camera system.Much like the Galaxy M20, the Galaxy M30 also houses a large 5,000mAh battery to offer a two-day battery life.

I read so many reviews says camera is worst but i feel the camera is good. The selfi camera is really good one. I was confused to go for M30 or Note 7 pro and finally decided to go with M30. I think that was good move. The phone looks premium even though the back is plastic.
Not sure about performance as i don't play games. The UI is good.Hope samsung will provide pie update with samsung one ui.
No notification light but it has always on screen feature which looks great.
There is no option for slow motion recording also no image stabilizetion. Battery is good. Speakers are nit loud but ok. Expecting pie update soon.",2 April 2019,5
116,Mikhil Kore,Great phone!,"Samsung Galaxy M30. What a mid-range phone. For just Rs.15000/- we get a very great display. The super AMOLED display delivers just the most crisp details. Everything is really clear and it will be great in direct sunlight as well. Next best thing about the phone is the triple camera. The portrait mode does it's job on point. The edgings are perfect. The wide angle mode is the signature feature in this phone. The 5000 mAh battery lasts for almost two days on one full charge. Gaming has become more fun on this phone with the 1.8GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor giving a very smooth gaming experience. Moreover the phone is super light.

CONS.
1.Poor chipset.Often lags.Not the best in the price segment.
2.Camera not good.Simply OVERHYPED.!",14 March 2019,4
120,Pranav Madhusudan,HIGHLY OVERRATED !!! Read this before you buy!,"This product is an over rated product. To be honest , there are a lot of upgrades which have to be done from Samsung through the software . The phone itself is slow I mean it very slow in opening from the lock screen or even an app. Takes forever to see your face and recognize it, fingerprint reader is slow and not up to the mark. Display is good and battery is good. I use this phone for phone calls and minimum apps as they will hang like all other Samsung do. Samsung needs to remove alot of unwanted apps and it's own galaxy apps and everything, slows down the phone alot.
Anyways I would suggest don't buy if you want a laggy and very slow phone .
I was so excited to buy this phone and then it turned out to be a huge huge disappointment. Sorry Samsung you need to really work on your processor and apps .
Please release the next software update to fix quiet alot of issues",22 April 2019,3

122,prachi,Best piece in the Range.,"This phone is pretty good. It comes with three cameras at back with 13 megapixel, 5 megapixel and 5 megapixel which makes me look professional and same goes with the front camera which makes me take amazing selfies. It's battery backup is really good, it has 5000mAH and supports proprietary fast charging, I need not worry attending all my classes and yet manage to play a couple of games on my phone. It's got face unlock so you can quickly unlock your phone using your face. Lots Of RAM means more applications can run at the same time, which makes the mobile faster. More storage allows you to store more songs, videos, photos and install more applications. Its one of the best picks for me.",13 March 2019,5
123,sai nihar,Has more positives than pullbacks,"The overall phone build is good. Some features that are good but not spoken about:-
1. Battery optimisation similar to AI battery usage.
2. Blue light filter present which reduces the strain on eyes.
3. Battery life is simply amazing without compromising the performance. It fetches one full day even on heavy use.
4. No unnesessary apps and most apps that are already present can be deleted. So, we get around 90% free internal storage.
5. It has dragon trail pro glass.
6. Very smooth performance.
7. Display due to SAMOLED and speaker sound due to Dolby ATMOS is excellent.
Marketing of the phone is not DONE well and It has many more good features

Now some drawbacks it has are:-
1. At this price the processor is not great in specs. Though, does multitasking well.
2. Call volume is low.
3. The entire phone, the screen as well as the back is a finger print magnet.
3. All Camera in outdoors and good light is good but not great low light photography.
4. The back cover is prone to scratches quickly, so get a back cover.
5. The glass also tends to get minute scratches but not easily seen.

126,Babu,Best features for the price,"I've been using M30 for the last 5 days and it has not let me down. The top features which prompted me to buy this phone are the Super AMOLED display, huge 5000 mAH battery and not to forget the dedicated memory slot. The display is crisp and beautiful and the battery is lasting 1.5 days since I am not a gamer, but I do watch movies and read ebooks. Prior to this I was using a Redmi Note 5 for the past 6 months which is also a good device but the OS MIUI was a big headache with it's ads everywhere. I am not a tech guy to know how to turn them off. So I was waiting for a device from Samsung and M30 it was. I got a 6GB+128 GB variant and it's smooth without any lags. But I love this display. The cameras are also good and give crisp and bright photos. Another feature which really impressed me is the Dolby Atmos for sound. I really mean it when I say M30 has the best features for it's price. Thank you Samsung for giving the M series.
The one thing I miss is the Android P update with Samsung One UI. Hopeful that Samsung gives these features very early with there update.",16 March 2019,5
127,pratap shrivastava,A Tough decision gone fails,"Today i will write a genuine review of this Samsung M30 after use of 1.5 month.
1. Rear camera quality is clear in outdoor mode but reading face is very poor and indoor plus night picture quality is very dull.
2. Front camera is good but no slo motion video available.
3. Battery life even after 5000 mah is just like making fool to us. Battery remains not even 24 hrs after heavy plus medium use. Totally fake 5000 mah battery.
4. Type C Charger is awesome. Keep it safe as this is realy good and original charger.
5. Touch screen and UIM is fine but little bit lagging in operating softwares.
6. Still no Android Pie is available.
7. No geomagnetic sensor given. False feature given.
8. Today people buy mobile for better picture quality. Camera feautres are less.
9. Screen having AmoLed is fine.
10. Ultra wide angle camera is 5 mwga pixel works but click very blur photo.
11. A mobile for 14990 is worst to buy as in less price than this mobile lots of option available.
12. Samsung dont provide screen protection and back cover with mobile so very hard to find cover and temperate glass in market.
13. Screen size 6.4 with notch display is fine.
14. Mobile goes heat up after heavy use and even charger gone heat up after charging mobile.",3 May 2019,1

It's having a huge 5000 mAh battery which is a good thing for heavy users. We can easily get 10-12. Hrs of screentime in this device.
Moving on to the charger it has USB type-C port which is actually a good thing. The charger is a fast charger that is 9 Volts at 1.6 ampere.
Coming on to the device it has a polycarbonate back with gradiant colour i.e. at the top it is more bluish and becomes black at the bottom. It actually gives it a premium look and also at the back we have finger unlock sensor.
In addition it has a dual SIM slot(both 4G) plus a dedicated micro SD slot also which is a nice thing as well.Its memory is expandable up to 512 gb.
The phone has Android oreo 8.1 and Samsung Experience 9.5 UI.
It's a good phone with good built quality and I like all the features especially the tripple camera setup. It has that wide angle lens which gives a different perspective and it is a good feature to have on a smartphone.

I had researched quite a few things about the phone before buying and trust me after having it delieverd at my place I wasn't disappointed. Lucky me.The features this phone has to offer is exciting and I can’t wait to get my hands on it, Samsung has like always layed the stone in the market and with the M series coming in, the phone has spoken for itself. The infinity display is just outstanding. The camera of the M30 is amazing, can’t wait to know what more it has in store for us. The music which is hitched with the Dolby sound is going to killiing it in the sound department. On an overall feedback I’d say this is phone is a must buy. Also, it comes witH 64GB storage and how can I forget such battery life. It has 5000MAH battery life which can work for 4 days, at least.

134,Sid,Good value for money phone but has few cons,"Have been using the device for almost 2 weeks now and also had an incident where the phone fell on the floor from a height of 2feet and the screen has cracked. What good is the gorilla glass !!!!
Battery is good lasts almost 2 days complete. Charging is faster than usual devices if u use the charger given in the package. The display is brilliant and rich. Camera is also better than Xiaomi devices. Face recognition is good though can be faster at times. I think the phone is a little slow not sure who else has experienced this but as compared to my other device which is a iPhone 7 this seems to be slow even when the native apps are being used. The other thing is that the adaptive brightness is not very adaptive, it reacts slowly to adapt to ambient light that also can be attributed to the device speed, so people should check this with other users as well",1 April 2019,4

Screen is the main usp and its fabulous also battery is perfectly powered
Picture quality is not so great when compare to mi or honor devises even oppo and vivo
Also there is heating and build quality issue as the rear fingerprint reader shakes a little and back is prone to scratches
I also have compared it with samsung a50 which the looks are same but a50 stands superior in miles when it comes to feel and camera but there is also a price difference of 5000 which is huge

140,Bhaumik B.,20% good phone and 80% warst,It is warst smart phone. Phone hange many times and sometimes phone touch unresponsive(3 to 4 times in day). 2 good points are cameras and battery. I suggest don't buy this phone. I am using smart phone till 2011 and this one(Samsung M30) is warst phone ever. I suggest please don't buy this phone and search other options.,28 March 2019,1
141,VLADIMIR WILSON,It could have been flawless... It can be made flawless though.,"I am very sensitive person when it comes to what phone I will choose. So my review will be extremely honest. And ""to the point"".. All Samsung users will understand but users of Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo may not understand. See down-
1. Display: This is the main reason of me purchasing this phone over any other phone. I am a user of Samsung A9 Pro which came in 2016. It was a flagship category phone at that time. Infact I am writing this review on it. Okay, lets get to the points why I said this. Display has Amoled and I like only Amoled panels. But when I placed A9 Pro side by side I felt M30 is 5% less bright. It can be fixed with just one update. I just mentioned it. It is perfect but it requires just one more update where the company can fix it.
2. Camera: The camera in A9 Pro is 16 MP and I believe Samsungs camera is the best and 16 MP is the highest it offers. Now M30 is 13MP. Forget that 3 cameras or what is there in the front. Most people in most cases only need the back camera. I am talking about that. I have taken a few shots like 20- 30 photos. And I got an idea. I can say camera is okay. But it cannot beat A9 Pro as of now. It requires just one update. By that I dont mean it is bad. I mean "" little bot of clarity"" is needed. Regular Samsung users will understand this point. One thing I dont like is this camera application does not allow quick launch from pressing lock key or volume key. Since A9 Pro had physical home button double pressing it launches the camera. Now it is gone. The company could given the option for double pressing volume button (down or up) or double pressing lock button just like Nokia 5.1 Plus. Or shake to launch just like Motorola phones.
So these are the main highlights of the phone that this phone has over M20. I discussed them in some details. Obviously I did not say how much pixel which camera has etc because I am not writing this review for naive users.
Let us now see some other aspects-
1. I did not like the hand feel. Now a days the companys are making vertically long phones. This effects the way we use phones. Hands cant reach the top. And yes this display appears smaller than A9 Pro because of this only. This ruins the feel of carrying a nice phone. It effects the aesthetics.
2. Other things are just okay. But I can say it cant still beat A9 Pro.
Conclusion: I believe the phone can be improved a lot by updates. The issues that mentioned are mostly software based. Not hardware. And ""it can be fixed by the company if it thinks so"". After that it will be near flawless. I said near beacause this phone is plastic. Thats the reason!",13 April 2019,4
142,Amazon Customer,Proximety sensor not working,"Look ,display and battery are good.but proximety sensor is not working so I hv to ask for replacement.i can't expect this from.samsung..very bad experience",2 April 2019,1
143,Amazon Customer,Lacking Features and Poor Performance,"This phone doesn't meet my expectations even after paying 18k didn't get 10k phone features
Such as, mirroring or cast, this phone is lacking those features where MI gives under 10k-15k range of phones

Antenna: I have checked at different location this phone has data speed issue whereas i have checked the same network gives better speed than this such as, MI MAX 2

Plus, Amazon service also not as flipkart
Amazon clearly says no to replace phone when you are dissatisfied with phone performance

Overall, Samsung should accept defeat against MI and other brands
now i know why, Samsung is losing market share to MI, Vivo, Oppo",14 March 2019,1
144,Basu,"Battery, Display, Speed, Camera!!! All Great.","Samsung has really created a masterpiece. I have been using it for the last 10 days. I have used other Samsung phones but this one is something different. Here, I am listing the pros and cons of this mobile phone.
Pros -
1- The battery is great. 5000 mah battery give you more than a full day backup on moderate use. The power saving mode of Samsung is worth going for. Use it wisely and I guess the juice will not run out for 2 or more days. I have tried that recently while I was traveling.
2- Display is awesome. It feels.
3- Design is also great. I have the blue one and it looks beautiful. The navigation settings let you make the navigation buttons disappear and you experience a better screen.
4- The fast charging works really fast.
5- Camera is great. Both front and back. Especially in low light conditions. Flash is awesome. Zoom is also great.
6- No Hybrid slot is what I seek in the phones these days. Thus, you are not limited by the storage issue if you are using the dual sim.
7- Dual 4g is good. Now, I can use my BSNL 3g and at the same time, my Jio works fine.
8- Face recognition and fingerprint unlocking are very fast.
9- Touch sensitivity is very much.
10- I got 200GB space on One Drive for two years free with this device.

Cons -
1- The wide angle lens needs some improvement. The picture quality is just OK. But as this is a new experience, I would not say its a major con.
2- The placement of earphone is downwards so when you want to use your phone earphone and charger plugged in, it becomes a little difficult to operate.

For now, this is my experience, I'll keep updating.",23 March 2019,4
145,sajad hussain rather,"SAMSUNG M30 SUFFERS NIGHT BLINDNESS, HYPERMETROPIA","I have bought this phone on flash sale after using this phone for about 8 days i am writing this review so that you could judge how it is worthy. I used many chinese phones and was fed up of hardware that they provide.
Pros:
1) Amazing Display
2) call quality is awesome
3) sound is Amazing
4) Hardware is always dependable i,e y brand matters
5) Battery lasts long,about 1 day using heavy like playing PUBG,calling, internet using and much more .And about 1.5 days using medium and 2_3 days using calling only.
6) Ram management is upto the mark.
7)Fast charger is really fast.
8) I am also a pubg lover and you can play pubg without lag at default settings.
Cons:
1) Worst rear camera 6/10 , may be it will get better after update,zooming image one time tears down image quality wholly .Front camera is not upto the mark 4/10
2) Processor is laggy but much better than previous ones .However it does the required work well.
3) Build quality is unimaginably weak.One can easily get display cracked if dropped on LCD side .Backside finish is premium but of polycarbonate which is not so strong to absorb shock.
4) Software needs to be patched so that UI may beome smooth.
5) Proximity sensor works only first time when you cover it during call and then doesn't wake display automatically next time which may be a software problem .May be after Pie update + One UI .
I am still happy with this phone because i found its pros more heavier than cons.",11 April 2019,3

147,karthik kannan,Loved it 😍😍,"I bought my device on 16 .after usage of 3 days it's working very smoothly and fastly.The performance on PUBG and FREE FIRE with high graphics is superb.But after gaming more than 1hour the battery slightly get heated.while it's common on every phone in this budget.
Next came to camera .Triple rear it's just amazing.the depth sensor with ultra wide angle camera gives u a perfect shot.The selfie camera is super even in low light .but the low light shots on rear camera it's not about full clarity .
The phone get charged within 2 hours with c type charger.The huge 5000mah battery did not get lesser than 25 %after heavy usage for a day.
I forgot about its display.its osm .because of AMOLED Screen .
The face lock works fast and also it recognizes ur face in low light conditions.
Fingerprint sensor is also too fast..
The speakers also work smoothly and loudly.
Finally if u want a better phone on all the segments simply go for it.",18 March 2019,5
148,Guru,Worth the money..,"Okay i have both 4 gb and 6 gb varients...

Now on 4gb we get everything smooth... Just the in game audio on speaker is slightly less... (mb due to in game call like pubg) however online games... Heavy games may give u a lag on 4 gb varient but 6 gb is flawless.. Pubg lovers can welcome this phone as there are zero lags and HD graphics supported.. So the full pc emulator view on your hands.
Camera... Is awsome with low light imaging and image stablization... Wide angle... Potrait mode... Nevertheless a beautiful camera...

I ll say go for it... It has a huge battery life and you can play games or use it over 10 hrs... Even if u use it savagly.

I pirchased 6gb from samsung directly however i got 4gb on flash sale.. The delivery i had was next day and got deliverd in 24 hrs.",29 March 2019,4

154,Debanjan Bhaumik,Overall A Good Product (initial review),"Overall the product is good, but the face recognisition doesn’t work well. The finger print recognition sensor has a lag aswell. The display is good and the battery life is decent in this price range. Dint try the gaming yet(will try to post d feedback after trying few good games). People who r upgrading from a smaller phone will have some difficulties in handling initially. The touch sensor is very good and you’ll get used to it within a couple of days. Video recording is decent, but the inbuilt speakers of the phone r not that great in terms of sound quality.
Camera quality is good not the best.
Overall its a decent device looking at the price range.
The phone is fast(not as fast as shown in the promo)

165,CoolDad101,Do not buy this product. Dead screen with phone ringing. Worst product & amazon customer service.,"The screen display died after 5 days. No software reset (vol down +power ) doesn’t reboot for display to get back. This phone rings and chimes but dead display. Phone is scratchless and spotless. We had barely transferred the data. These days for seniors this is the only line of communication for outside world with all critical help numbers from doctors to plumbing to electricians.
I am seriously never going to buy the Samsung phone or other expensive item from amazon.
After calling amazon they scheduled a no show technician and have delayed and refused to replace the phone thus far.
This phone is for senior citizen with medical condition and amazon instead of helping quickly has been delaying the replacement for last 6 days.
Worst phone. This was replacement for 4 year old iPhone 6s which never ever went bad.
Worst amazon customer service for not assisting in quick replacement for senior citizen with medical condition.",14 April 2019,1

167,Tablaty,"Perfect All Rounder, Battery Master","I have been using this phone since last three weeks and has fallen in love with this piece of budget phone. I am not a gamer, so my basic needs are a lot of calls, few snapshots including scanning some documents with CamScanner, a bit of music and movies, WhatsApp, surfing net and, of course, long battery life. To my surprise, it meets all my needs.
Here I have tried to sum up my review in the form of Pros and Cons.
Pros:
---------
1. Stunning Super Amoled Display- I am pretty sure it will also be the first thing to attract everyone. It shows very deep colours which u won't see in normal lcd/tft displays.
2. Its Big battery- True 5000 mah battery. It gives me two days power. It takes around 2h 20m to get fully charged, which I think really fast for such a big battery.
3. Dedicated Card Slot which is rare nowadays (Believe me, I am one of those who will never buy a phone with Hybrid slot)
4. Adaptive Fast charging and inclusion of fast charger in the box.
5. Camera Configuration, especially the wide-angle camera. Shutter speed is also remarkably fast. It gives stunning pictures in daylight, though low light performance is bit down. But considering the price, I don’t have any grudge about it.
6. Beautiful Colour with radiation effect.
7. Beautiful u notch front camera whole with minimum bezels around the display.
8. Call Clarity - both audio and video
9. Speaker output is great. Listening to music and watching movies are great experience.
10. Samsung Experience v9.5. It has most of the the features and gestures one needs in an android device. I love the OS very much, especially as compared to Xiomi and Honor phones.
11. Always on display is an added beauty as well as advantage.
12. Superfast and accurate Fingerprint Scanner and Face Unlock.

Cons:
---------
None for me so far. Only I miss a Back Case in box which nowadays every company is providing, even Samsung is also providing cases in other phones.
As I am not a gamer, I have nothing to say about the Processor. Please read some other reviews for this particular point of view. But I can say its RAM Management is great. It keeps all the apps and processes in memory until I manually kill one. This is I think a great point to notice while buying a smartphone.",23 April 2019,5

Excellent photos
Face unlock security
Very Good battery life
Awesome touch response
Stylish Design and Sexy looks
Spectacular Call clarity

Cons:
No Headphones
Very slippery back surface... So carrycase is a Must

169,Mohini Goel,"Worst phone, launched in it's beta stage by Samsung. Don't buy.","The signal reception on the phone is very very poor and when rarely it does appear there is sharp crackling sounds during the call which makes impossible for calls. Initially my mom ignored the problem but now when I re-checked it, I realized it's an hardware issue and the return window of 10 days is closed already. Do not buy. Amazon's flash sale is only a fraud concept.",29 March 2019,1
170,AkshaySulakhe,"Good phone for the price. Smooth, ultra wide cam is awesome, selfie cam is really good","Device is really good for the amount of money. Samsung bought this phone as a competitor for Redmi Note 7. Although I don't know how this competition is fairing, the advantages I see are triple cam with Ultra-wide angle lens, large battery, buttery smooth UI. Many people are complaining that there is no Android 9.0 on it. Android 8 is on maximum devices, and OS upgrades take time. Here are some of the pros and cons I found :

Pros :
1) Ultra wide angle lens is really good for landscape shots, I like that 123 degrees view
2) Selfie cam is really good, I can see it in video calling, images, etc.
2) Huge battery, fast charger provided in the box.
3) UI is smooth, easy to navigate, there are a lot of settings I have not digged into, as I am not getting that much time.
4) Video calling with JIO works and it is shown in dialer directly.
5) Date and time shown on lock screen, which doesn't consume lot of battery due to Amoled screen
6) Video quality is really good, picture reproduction is awesome.
7) Keyboard is smooth, looks a lot like IOS
8) Infinity screen looks really good.

Cons :
1) Low light on rear cam is not that good.
2) There is an app called LightStories, which is showing notifications even though I have turned it off.
3) There is no vertical scrolling option when all apps are opened

Hope this helps!",22 March 2019,4
171,Sakshi Jain,Must buy!,"So honestly, speaking when it comes to getting a mobile phone I do a lot of reseach but owning Samsung M30 makes me feel good! So me being me, photoholic M30 provides with amazing 13MP camera,supports Face Detection and high dynamic range(HDR) imaging as well. It is perfectly appropriate for people who considers battery backup above all. With such great features, the charging port at the bottom is reversible Type-C and the SIM tray has a dedicated card slot.Also, one can effortlessly look through photographs and send messages on the 6.38 inches .Okay now the best part its super long lasting battery life. Being always ready with 64 GB+ 4GB memory and having 3X charging capability is what makes it different from others. There’s no denying that the Samsung Galaxy M30 is super classy, affordable, easy to access and is a must buy. If you’re looking for a phone with big battery and good camera, Galaxy M30 is worth having. And not to forget its light weight and lastly, I am a happy customer of Samsung M30",21 March 2019,5
172,Ankit C.,Average Phone!,"Worth 15K this is just another average phone.
With a slight lag in the user interface, it does sport a good screen whereas the performance remains on the slower side.
I'll rate it 3 out of 5",11 March 2019,3
173,Rahul,Average phone which looks really good..,"Average phone... you're better off with an Asus or a moto.. the UI is very inconvenient.. takes a lot of getting used to.. even then using the phone is an annoyance rather than second nature.
The screen is super bright so that's a plus . And the battery backup is very very good... if it was a more sturdy build would have served a better purpose as a work phone coz you don't have to ask anyone for a damn charger.
That stupid pin with which you take the sim slot out should be banned for all phones. Could have had some other mechanism or at least give me a place to keep it..
The colour reproduction is okay... seems a bit washed out.
Random bugs and lags especially during basic functions like calls... very very annoying.
Finally the biggest drawback... the touch accuracy is down the drain... I have to touch min 5 times to pause a damn video... it's a nightmare if I want to skip ahead.
So if you need a phone maybe just to call and basic WhatsApp then this is the guy .. doesn't look too shabby... performs alright.. battery is awesomeness.
But if you want a little more out of your phone.. just go to the other 5000 mah battery ones.
Only reason I got this phone was for the fast charging 5000 mah battery which I wasn't getting anywhere else.",10 April 2019,3

The camera system includes a 13MP primary camera with f/1.9 aperture, a 5MP wide-angle camera and another 5MP camera for depth sensing. On the front, the Galaxy M30 gets a 16MP front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture. The handset ships with Android 8.1 Oreo with Samsung's Experience UI 9.5 on top. The M30 supports dual Nano SIM cards with support for Dual 4G standby.The Galaxy M30 sports a large 6.4-inch Super AMOLED FHD+ (2340x1080) display. Samsung is using its Infinity-U panel for the Galaxy M30, which offers a U-shaped waterdrop notch on the top of the display to house the selfie camera. The Galaxy M30 comes with a plastic rear panel in gradient colours. It also sees a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and vertical triple camera system.Much like the Galaxy M20, the Galaxy M30 also houses a large 5,000mAh battery to offer a two-day battery life.

Being a college student we're at college or internships during the day and we only get home late at night,so I know with this phone I don't have to worry about the phone dying on me. Another thing I don't have to worry about is space on my phone, although it is 128 gb it is expandable to 512gb. The security on the phone is amazing with the face scanning feature as it is very accurate. The phone comes with Dolby Atmos 360° surround sound which makes listening to music even more fun!

181,jaison elias,"Excellent phone, can compete with redmi note 7 pro.","Camera is bad, too much lengthy phone, 6.4 inch screen is too high,,, no need of this much big display. Amoled display is soo sooper. Loving it. Dolby atmos with my one plus bullets wireless earphones is excellent. Battery will last one day in very high usage.... Even 2 days in low usage. Fast charging takes almost 2hrs 15 minutes to full charge 5000mah battery from 5 percent. UI is better for me. Not that much glamorous in looks. I hope not to find any lag issues with exynos processor. I am not a gamer. But i am high user of internet, social media, and lots of other things.... Found no specific problems in it. It will take some time to learn all settings in it. I am loving it besides of its size. (bottom bessels are somewhat larger)",9 April 2019,5

There are many camera features missing especially slow motion n timelapse which mostly I prefer they must've enabled.

Finally it's completely a entertainment specific device mean Super amoled display with Dolby atmos and supports Amazon prime n Netflix HD content and my favourite hotstar for watching cricket matches.

184,Dipanjan Ghosh,Like if you agree,"Writing after one month use. The product is good for everyday use... easy to hold not like other vivo oppo mobiles which has problem of holding due to big size... screen battery and wide angle camera is top notch. Samsung need to work on camera software. Picture taken is good compared to note pro most of the time due to great dynamic rage, but potrate mode and absence of eos video qualities are not that good. So Samsung hope you will improve image stabilization... If yoh afe thinking you need a good mobile with great battery and for normal photography and watches YouTube's video or movie this is the one for you.... please like if you are impressed by the photos taken by me from m30...",8 April 2019,5

Picture quality is good.
Display with notch looks fantastic.
Finger print is better than face unlock.
Finger print should have placed little down.. its difficult to touch..
For heavy games it's not sutiable.
The only think I have disappointed is there is no notification led..
Overall phone is good..
It could be better if they provide earphones and pouche..",15 March 2019,4
186,preetham,M30 Cons should know before buying,"I have many complaints

1) It's (m30)marketed as exynos 7904 processor but , I got a unit with exynos 7885 processor . This is main cheating .

2)There is no light sensor , (I know front camera act as light sensor) but it's speed is pathetic I have adjust brightness every time . Shame for device of 15000 Rs cost .

3)Even after taking calls screen will not lit up automatically I have to manually do it(because of lack of light sensor and poor quality of proximity sensor ).

4) Speaker volume is not good (compare to old Samsung feature phones) and sound cracks more often . Head phone volume is low and it's not having good quality like old Samsung phones .

5)Ultra wide angle camera quality is waste it's 5mp wide angle so no details in pictures at all .

6) No native support for using amoled screen as led notification light . Have to use NoLED third party app.

7) 13MP main camera fully waste . Pictures taken have short range clarity but doesn't have details of distance objects (remember my old Motorola g4 get more detailed distance shots). I think camera module is not up to the mark (cost cutting ???)

8) status bar fonts are very small and no option to add extra icons like internet speed etc , there is no option in setting to increase status bar font .

9) data toggle buttons ( between to two Sims ) is not available in notification bar.

10) Samsung Galaxy apps always runs in background and collecting your information , no option for galaxy apps to stop in background and apply battery optimization. Often ""install galaxy apps "" ad pops up very annoying .

11) Even phone colour theme cannot be changed unless you buy Samsung Galaxy themes

12) Exynos processor means to no custom ROM development.

13)Fragile screen with no screen protection (dragon tail is there but no good).

14) fast charger is total waste , you can't get much charge in short time so no 5 min charge and talk 2 hours like feature .

15) No otg support for laptop hard disc with external case ( even some old phones support other for hard disc).

16)No correct size external cases and tempered glass support .",19 April 2019,2

Vibrant Colour production
Decent battery..",16 March 2019,4
188,Dipankar Das,Good Quality and value for money but need more improvement," I am using this phone since last few days and I already shared review on Samsung M30 in my YouTube Channel ""Arvin Toys Review"" and now I am hereby sharing my review as under:

Pros:

1)Regarding Nozzle Display : It's best in the market. Easily beating MI Phone
2)Touch Screen : very smooth and fast response
3)Camera : Best quality one with new features of wide angle photos. Very good quality.
4)Battery : it's having 5000mah battery but not so impressive. It's last only one day. It's performance is almost same with 4000mah battery of Redmi phone.
5)External Memory : Unlike Redmi, it has dedicated SD card slot which removed our worries about running out of storage. Another thumbs up.
5) Network Strength : it's quite disappointing. At same place with same service provider SIM, Redmi phones has more signal strength than M30.
6) No stutter/ lag: Smooth experience when it comes to daily usage.
7) Minimal Heating: Very less heating. Some people have complained about heating during calls. I haven't faced any.
8) Call Clarity: It’s perfect

Cons:

1) No charging indication light
2) Notification Lights is not available
3) Head Phone is not included with the Box
4) Fast charging is not happening. Takes about 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 10%. Yes 2 hours is a lot but even the battery is large.
5) Pre-loaded security app not available.
6) Limited pre-loaded ring tones types

Overall I am quite satisfied and will recommend my friends can have a try with this one.",22 April 2019,4

When you talk about the battery it has a fantastic 5000mah battery life and to accompany this it supports fast charging so within no time your battery is powered up which then gives it a healthy backup for hours. In terms of the camera it packs a triple rear camera set-up with a 13-megapixel primary sensor, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 5-megapixel wide angle camera when you talk about the front camera it has a 16 megapixel camera which can handle selfies easily.

It has 3 cameras with a wide angle lens that will help me capture wide shots all in one frame. Really excited for the infinity screen now Samsung does too. Another great feature, would be the Android version that is Oreo & also the long life battery which is essential for daily use & work. The phone also has 6gb ram and finger print touch, Now that's impressive and the best part is that the phone is Pocket friendly considering all the features that are being provided. Overall the phone is great and I will definitely recommend it to others.

The triple camera concept is marvelous with amazing clarity beating the top camera phones or professional cameras in the market and same goes for the front camera as the selfies come out clean and makes everyone look so good. The battery life is the best thing as it comes along with 5000 mAh that makes it run through out the day and is beneficial during vacations as I plan to go on trips with my family and play PUBG throughout the day.

Camera.. i had doubts about the portrait mode initially... but took some outdoor photos and turned out to be amazing. Portriat on low lights may not be as good.. but phone cameras are not quite meant for night shots.
Screen .. best in market.. Amoled
Have not faced any lag even after opening 10 to 12 apps together ..

Cons
i was using galaxy note 3 previously .. so the audio from speaker is not as good. its the same loud and all ...but not as good.. but headphones output is just amazing compared to note 3

The phone runs very fast, you can switch to apps very fast. The battery life is very long, one full charge can be use for 48 hours with moderate use. The Turbo Charger charges the phone Very Fast as compare to normal charger. The super Amoled screen does its magic very well on your eyes as you would feel like using a premium segment moblie.

Speaker sound is somewhat clarity and loudness lacks. In headphone music dolby atmos doesn't adds any wow effect. Very flat sound in headphone not boomy. Superb display with decent viewing angle.

208,Dhaval,One of the best mid range smartphones by Samsung!,"Where to begin. It's been a month using this smartphone . Believe me guys I generally doesn't use to recommend any Samsung smartphone of this range . Bt this product just made me change my opinion for the Samsung smartphones

Pros:

Battery is remarkable it easily give u backup for one complete day with heavy usage . I usually get 30-40% battery at the end of the day

Dolby atmos gives total different experience for audio output if using bluetooth speakers or any headsets I use boat earpiece. For better music experience use Poweramp music player

Display what to say about it. Super amoled at this price range is cherry on the top. Viewing experience is top notch .

Camera micro shots are superb amazing selfie cam does it job in the best way it can at this price range

Tripple slot 2 sims+1 dedicated SD card slot gives u opportunity to use both sims and expand your storage simultaneously

FEATURE LIKE APPS MOVING TO SD CARD IS BACK! I mean finally this feature Is back which helps u to free your internal storage more conveniently and effectively

Themes interface n icons lockscreen everything is so perfectly designed and user friendly n that too most of them are free. Not many bloatware apps and ads.

Cons:

Back cam struggles a bit can n improved in further updates but a simple advice try to use Retrica app it gives the best result with both front and back cam .u will definitely gonna surprise with the results with the pics taken from the app even low light experience gets far better once used retrica app .

Audio output as in with speakers could have been better .

Processor is also an aspect where it lags a bit . But If u r not a much into high end games with great graphics u can go for it . Day to day multi tasking can easily be handled with the processor smoothly

Final conclusion : if battery brand and viewing experience is your priority go for it . Not for heavy end gamers tho camera experience can b improved by using the app mentioned above.

Thank you!",7 May 2019,4
209,Naveen Ram C G,Samsung m30 the cool phone,"I just got the phone as the same in the model. I like everything .Best phone. For a user like me,it is a better phone in my budget. Good packaging by Amazon. Well packed. No damages and fast delivery in the third day. Cool phone . Performance is good. No lags . Good processor. The camera works better than I expected. 16 mp front cam with live focus is great. The wide angle and depth sensor each of 5 mp adds to the rear cam of 13 mp. Good camera performance. Battery is 5000 maH. That is great. In normal use , we can use it for more than days after a full charge. Fast charger is available with the box. It doesn't even take 1 hour to charge my phone from 44 to 100. Fast phone.5/5for face recognition. Fingerprint unlock is some microseconds late and it is unnoticeable. Actually it is fast. Samsung provides super amoled led display in this range. The quality of display is awesome. The display covers more than 90 percent of screen. It's cool. The weight and size of phone is manageable. Slow motion videos are not available. 4k recording is not possible. There is less heating problems. Heating can be considered normal.Dual messenger /WhatsApp.. options are available.It has a slot which accommodates two nano sims and a micro SD card Also,auto brightness is present.Brightness is automatically adjusted.

210,Amazon Customer,SUPERB DISPLAY...,"Excellent sAMOLED FULL HD+ display (side by side comparasion with s9+ which hv quad HD+)
Sound quality is good but not too loud and dolby atmos is nice but only available on headphone not on phone speaker,
Camara is good @ this price point but redmi note 7 pro done great job here,
Ram management was excellent,but little slow/lag due to exynos 7904 processor,but acceptable

Finally BATTERY,no other phones(asus M1,M2,RN7 PRO,Moto one power,oppo,vivo,realme series)can't beat this beast on this category even samsung A series and other M series(due to LCD) also,because of sAMOLED meets 5000 mah battery here.surely you will get maximum of SOT than anyothers.(one of the main reason to buy this).,
15W Fast charger is bundled(not like RN7PRO),even flagship s9+/s10+/note series also hav same charger

214,Numan Nazir,M30 FULL REVIEW,"I have been using this product for over a month now and for me the highlight of the phone is the battery and the display.

The display which is a sAMOLED display is simply amazing, I loved every second of every video I watched on it.

The battery is humongous, I use this phone all day for shooting my YouTube videos, movies, internet, hotspot and easily I get about 10 hrs of screen on time.

If, however you game heavily or even moderately you might get around 7 to 8hrs of screen time as I dont game much on the device. However, I did try pubg on this phone, the phone ran smoothly on lower graphics, but when I played with higher settings the phone did show some frame drops.
The phone does not use a Snapdragon processor like the rest of the devices in the price range but over all the ram management and the processing of the phone is good so far.

The next feature I very much love is the fast charging of the phone, as I already said the battery of the phone is huge and coupled with fast charging the combo is a must have, plugging in my phone for 15 minutes easily gives me screen time of about 2.5 hrs which is amazing.

The only thing I DON'T LIKE about the phone is the camera.
Talking about the back camera, the primary camera is a 13 Mp coupled with a ultra wide lenses.
The primary came show the pictures a bit washed out, which could have been easily gotten rid of by a simple software, but even in the latest PIE update the phone recieved, the issue still remains.
The ultra wide camera in a phone is amazing featureto have, but a 5MP module of the phone just doesn't cut it.
The front camera is a 16 MP camera and j use it for YouTube video shooting, but the footage has a noticeable digital noise.

VERDICT: Given the camera and the processor is somewhat a weak point of the phone, it's still a value buy if, your top most priority is a good display and an amazing battery backup. Not only that the phone has a solid build and a good speakers if not amazing.",8 June 2019,4

6) Speaker volume is very very low. In side the house itself you can’t hear the music.

219,MRINAL RAY,Jack of all trades,"M30- Jack of all trade, master of none.
In a good sense..
Coz you dont need a cell phone which has only a good camera, or a battery, or fingerprint sensor.

Screen is way too awesome. Supports 2k videos playback. (I know i know u dont care, coz 1080 looks way too sharp) but still.
Speakers are loud enough to listen to (dont sell your music system coz this is just a phone) blues and jazz with pin point music amplification.
Camera is fine, it will not fetch you oscar but for insta and snapchat its way more than enough.
Slo-mo are super sick to watch and shoot.
Performance is like a retired racing horse.
(Atleast retired ones are trained than a wild one)

Conclusion:- its not a worst phone. It acts like a cell phone. And priced like a cell phone. In other words you will use each of its feature in a day to day basis.
(Not like other which has tones of feature but no place to use eg:- gesture control, animoji,tounge and wink detection,3D pressure touch (you got the point, didnt you??)",14 May 2019,5

221,Shubham Gupta,Best Battery Life!,"This is my honest experience of Galaxy M3o

222,Sulochana,Not That much excited One...,I am so much excited but after receiving the phone very disappointed screen was not good and Functionality also very bad.,28 March 2019,1
223,Rohit Tiwary,Power-packed and worth the price. Go for it.,"The best phone in the range, we could call it. If we talk about cons, I can speak volumes. The battery life is superb. For a heavy user, it will last for a day or a day n a half. Camera reflects professionalism. Quality pictures are no more a dream for budget oriented phones. Good for gaming too, as there is no heating issue. UI feels great. The design of the phone is also a boon. The polycarbonate back mounted with triple cameras and the infinity U display and the sleek design makes the phone look great in our hands. About the display, i don't think we can get anything better than this. The superamoled display gets me mesmerised every time I unlock this device.
About the cons, i am yet to face them. No cons as of now.
Go for it, you wont regret.",18 March 2019,5
224,Amazon Customer,Best value for money product.,Such a good product. And best battery backup I have ever use. Best value for money product.,16 March 2019,5
225,J.G.Krishnaa,Best of the Best-Its a Beast!!!,"What you feel and say if you have not got any CONS in a smartphone. Samsung M30 is that model. Samsung has really done good innovation with M30. The mobile is butter soft and fire speed. Here goes my reviews after using it for 3 weeks. I am always using a device experiencing it & testing then only busying myself on the keyboard to write a ""Review- A genuine review"" so that it can help other customer attached to Amazon. This M30 is definitely a Total Paisa Vasool for your hard earned money. I brought a 6/128GB variant on a lightening deal.

Camera - (Check the image clarity & crisp on the attached above image taken from M30 Autofocus mode) Average good color saturation and focus even Bookeh effect and Palm jesture options. This quality is more than enough for a daily or often usage. Don't expect a DSLR out of it ha ha ha.
Battery - Huge backup to run for more than a day. Thanks to SuperAmoled display
Processor - Ultra clock speed. Exynos is doing its job. As I played PUBG the most advanced graphic & RAM tester game ever made.
Design - Super cool & young generation style. Gradation look is something Unique from Samsung.
Sound/Audio - Dolby Atmos what more u want. Sitting in the crowded cab felt like Theatre Dolby experience crisp and clear+DUAL Sound effect of background+vocal speech in less volume you can hear all the details which I was missing in other smartphones till date. Even the Headphones earphones and also Speaker volume also too good due to Dolby Atmos sound engineering becos of this I felt comfortable in watching a movie over the Speaker which I never used with other smartphones till date used so far. The Bass of the Speaker u can feel it and on high volume also its not getting break.
Display - A unique MASSIVE FHD SuperAmoled on 6.4 inchs display (good battery saver known fact)
This M30 is Highly recommended. Buy and experience its magic performance then u will surely find my reviews true. Go for it don't think back!!!! Thanks Amazon for fast delivery and the Seller for delivering me in a Good package. Buy today and experience smooth silky speed of Samsung M30.",1 June 2019,5
226,Akash,Best display you can get,"After some years this is my another Samsung device.To be exact I have opt to buy another Samsung device after j7pro.The best thing is the display and the battery life of this device. It is a pleasure to watch videos in this amoled screen. Battery life is good no issues with day.Heavy users can get 1day easily and normal usage it can get easily one and half day or 2days(my usage).
But the major con for me when I get this device is the lack of secure folder or inbuilt app lock.Yes M30 don't have any built inapp lock as of now.I suggest to download Norton app lock from play store over other apps as it is from a reputed developer and also it doesn't hamper the phone(lag).
And please don't believe the so called reviewer everywhere saying this exynos chip isn't capable. It is capable enough to do what you need to to with a smart phone every day though I suggest everyone to go for 6gb variants if you are a game buff or performance maniac.And yes it now run on Samsung latest one UI with android pie.just check the update after few minutes after you completed the setup process.
Hope this ultra long boarin review help you.Thanks.",13 June 2019,5
227,Harishchandra Yadav,Awesome mobile M30 in low budget,"Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone. I love it",24 April 2019,5
228,AKHILESH SINGH,Amazing phone in this price,"My last phone was Randi note5 pro
After that I purchase note7 pro
I purchase this for my brother and after one day use I gave him my note 7 pro and keep it
This time Samsung rocks
Phone is excellent in this price range
Pros- amazing display those who spend more time on YouTube and videos it's more than perfect
Battery is excellent 2 days use in single charge
No lagging
Camera is better than fake Chinese brands who depends on mega pixels
Wide angle is useful
Cons- back side of phone need cover or lamination because it got scratches

In my opinion if I want a perfect combination of power, display and camera than blindly go for it.
And one thing most important this is not Chinese brand this is Korean and this brand doing more gd work 4 India as Samsung established biggest phone manufacturing unit in noida. So love Samsung 4 this and made in India phone.",20 April 2019,5

Happy Telugu Ugadi New Year Wishes To Every One..Tq.,7 April 2019,5
230,Amazon Customer,"Good Camera and Display, Processor not so much","The plus point of this phone is the display, ultra wide camera and the battery life. If you're someone who takes a lot of photos, and consumes a lot of media on there device then this phone is for you.

Pros:
-sAMOLED Display
-Ultra Wide Lens
-Battery Life

Cons
-Slower Processor
-Software (Samsung Experience 9.5 looks dated design wise)
-Plastic Body

Personally I haven't noticed much difference in using the AMOLED Display but this might change with time. One thing you might need to keep in mind (I found out about this a little too late) is the processor is closed source so third party ROMs development might not be there. They should have shipped it with Android P and the one UI which is more polished.

If you want a phone for camera and media consumption then buy the M30, otherwise if you want a durable phone with better android experience and processor get the Moto One Power.

EDIT: After a week of usage I do not find the camera upto the mark, Images lack sharpness and they look a grainy when zoomed in even a bit. This was a huge let down as I expected this phone to have a better camera.",23 March 2019,3
231,Harsha,LOVE THIS PHONE.,"Loving this phone. With such great features. The charging port at the bottom is reversible Type-C and the SIM tray has a dedicated card slot. For a person who likes clicking pictures, 13 MP is amazing. It also supports Face Detection and high dynamic range(HDR) imaging. Also, you can effortlessly look through photographs and send messages on the 6.38 inches HD screen. Being battle ready with 4+64 GB memory and having 3X charging capability is what anyone would love to have. It is perfectly apt for consumers who prioritize battery backup above all else. There’s no denying that the Galaxy M30 is super comfortable to wield. Affordable, easy to access, and of one of the most trustworthy brand, Samsung Galaxy M30 is a must buy. If you’re looking for a phone with big battery and good camera, Galaxy M30 is worth considering. It is light weight with amazing display which can be expected from Samsung because it’s a brand which always has an additional feature to spice things up. This phone being available at just IMR 14,990 is surprising!",13 March 2019,5

233,pratiti,Galaxy m30 review,"Have been using xiaomi phones for the past few years... Just wanted to try Samsung's new budget phone launched to compete with xiaomi. But really disappointed... Xiaomi is way ahead of samsung... As its much more user friendly. It doesn't have in built app lock facility.. We have to download it from play store. It's Screenshot capture function is way too pre historic(volume +power key pressing thing...)as compared to mi's three finger swipe. It's face recognition unlocking feature doesn't always work. It allows only three fingers to add for finger print scanning unlike mi, which allows ten fingers.
Though it supports fast charging... The phone doesn't charge so fast.
So overall not so happy.
But only silver lining is its rear triple camera & good selfie camera.",14 May 2019,3
234,Ayushmaan Rastagi,Budget Monster.,"Face Recognition is not so good on this phone, the device fails to recognize you if there is a slight change.

Amazing Battery Life.
Smooth UI.
Amazing Selfies.
Good Performance.
Works Smooth In Day To Day Tasks.
Looks Good.
Sleek.
Fast Charge.
Amazing Game Performance.
CONS:-
No Processor Upgrade(Same SoC as M20)
Low Light Camera Performance is not so good.

235,Nav,Average phone with unnecessary hype,"First putting this mobile on sale is the most bogus thing by amazon, seller n samsung. I received my order after 4days by Amazon delivery most slow not happy.Also package bag is little open but product is in fine state.

Now comes to product it is very average looking samsung phone.I have to setup it 3 times as in first go i setup quickly then ads came while unlocking it.
2nd time after factory reset when apps downloaded their icons not shown on screen.
So in 3rd attempt i got success in setting phone according to my settings.(very headache process)
No headphones at this price range and a small charging cable are again part of cost cutting for company n loss to customers.
You have to buy a good cover otherwise its a slippery phone to handle.
As for now its working fine no other issue...will update further.",19 May 2019,4

Recent software update for android pie and one Ui makes this device more beautiful and value for money. Camera quality is overall good but rear camera is not good for low light photography,otherwise rear camera performence is very well in daylight. Selfi camera is excellent. Battery performence is not up to the mark as a 5000 mAh battery. Sound quality and display quality are the best things in this device. Overall impressive device.",22 June 2019,5

This phone's fingerprint reader is 0.4 micro second slow than any other phone but this is not a matter to criticize this phone. This phone has super amoled display and the screen quality is very good. This phone has everything what ever you want. Really this phone is value for money.,21 April 2019,5
240,Amazon Customer,Using from past 3 months and these are my observations,"Build quality: plastic, where we get glass back at the same price in other phones like 7
Battery: serves the purpose.. even after binge watching for 6hours it lasts for 1 day..
Display: Excellent..super amoled with L1 certification... watching HD content is really worth the price..
No head phones..which is sad..
Sound quality when in call and through headphones both are better..
Type C charger..which takes almost 2-3hours to fully charge..
Camera: front camera is better when compared to its competitors like note 7 pro..
Back camera just serves the purpose..its just ok.. nothing great to talk about..7 pro is far better at this price range..
Storage and ram 64 gigs with 4 GB Ram..quite better
Processor:exynos...just does it work..not so fast compared to snap dragon 675 ..
No heating seen even after using continuously for 10-11 hours watching movies in Netflix..
No night mode and slow motion videos.. which is very pathetic at this price point.
No Software bloat..love one UI samsung interface with Pie update..
Very good at signal reception while I'm using jio and even the net speed is too good not sure about the other phones at this price point",18 June 2019,3
241,Divya Mahajan,Samsung M30,"What's the reason to like M30 there are reasons 50
Rear camera is good with a 3rd camera an extra feature to expand the picture ( but blurs the picture a little) but still good
Front camera is also better can take very nice selfie
Battery life is very good even at 24 percent it worked and I charged next day And also charges fast
Screen touch is smooth and screen size too good
Loving it very much
Fingerprint scanner easy to use but have to store fingerprint scans to be able to use this feature unlike Redmi phones where if no scan is stored anybody can use to unlock screen
I have been using for around 2 months now and very satisfied
Also I compared SAR values and bought it for its low SAR value than some other brands",27 May 2019,4
242,Meet Patel,"Beautiful Screen, Great Battery Life, Multi - Tasker! Samsung M30 : A Game Changer❤","The Samsung galaxy M30 is a amazing Phone. The device has a super amoled 6.4 inches full HD + (2280×1080) pixels resolution. Battery backup is perfect to last the entire day even on high usage. I pay lotts of heavy gaming applications (pubg). The triple camera on the device is very useful to take background blur, zoom and wide angel photos which enhance the picture quality. It feels very great to watch movies on the bigger screen. You can use multiple Sims at the same time it allows you to use two Sims without the need of carry two mobile at the same time. It has some bunch of cool features in a pocket friendly handset. As it is a very light weight device its very comfortable to hold it with one hand. Overall this phone is worth the money, I'd definitely recommend this phone.",13 March 2019,5
243,customer,Average. Samsung can't make good budget phones. Nokias are better.,"Using this one since a month now hence thought will give an unbiased account.

Good:
1. AMOLED display is vibrant. Always on display feature is better than a notification light.
2. Battery life is sufficient for more than a day in average usage on 3g/4g connectivity.
3. Infinity display helps justify the phone size in pocket and while browsing docs or webpages.

Bad:
1. AOD missing customization options. Ex. Motorola Droid ultra like AOD-check YouTube videos for comparison.
2. People say Samsung batteries malfunction after 6-9 months and deteriorate in performance. I can feel that at times but I think it's not the battery tech, but the software interface which is poor in resource and power management.
3. Microphone clarity is not like Nokia.
4. Camera is average, especially low light photography is really poor.

Ugly:
1. Software interface is shit. Samsung one UI or Android one on Nokia is better..much better.
2. Phone hangs! Yes 6gb phone hangs while using apps. The on screen buttons freeze. Exynos processor coupled with the poor software interface are a pain in the arse. Poor processor performance compared to Asus snapdragon phones or even Nokia 6.1 plus.",23 April 2019,2

Your this model I selected forthese reasons . Till now I have not used it as a substitue for professional camera nor watchng a TV show or movie.Samsung Galaxy M30 (Gradation Black, 4+64 GB) is helping me but I do not want to change my hand set frequently as that kills my time to make the new mobile user freindly",27 May 2019,5

With a single full charge (Requiring almost 2 hrs) at 8.00 AM , the battery has enough juice (65% remaining) at 8.00 PM with moderate number of phone calls and moderate to heavy internet use. The Super Amoled display is crisp and vibrant.
On the flip side Exynos processor is somewhat slower and a buttery smooth scrolling experience is somewhat missing. Camera quality is good. Overall, the phone is worth buying.",15 March 2019,4

M30 - 4+64 Samsung M30 is the combination of all the best features out there. To begin with the camera this time it comes Triple rear cameras, I really enjoyed using the wide angle feature because it is so much wider than any other cameras right now at this price, The live does a pretty good job while blurring the Background giving a really cool DSLR effect. Samsung is always known for it's display this one is no exception it comes with this really cool Amoled display with a Infinity U setup with amazing screen to body ratio.

With Samsungs Exynos 7904 processor the phone works extremely smoothly without any worries of multitasking. I can use the phone for the entire day and the phone will always last because of the 5000mAh battery which makes life so much better than just around the charger.

No matter how good the camera, processor or display might be, if the UI isn't smooth then the device will simply not be worth it. I want to return this but as per Amazon technical support app, this is working perfectly fine.",13 April 2019,1
260,Deepak,Worth the price,"Wonderful product so far! Haven't encountered any major problems so far. The phones is overall a good budget smartphone.
Pros-
1)Great Battery Life
2)Large storage as well as ram
decent processor (hasn't slowed the phone down)
3)Great Screen
4)Good front camera
all at a decent price tag.

Cons-
1) Rear Camera is not what you would expect
2) In my model specifically, the SD card didn't fit into the slot
3) Massive storage also results in longer loading time (sometimes)

Other than that, I think if you're looking for a decent, dependable and good smartphone under 20k, this is the phone for you",18 June 2019,4

It has large screen and feels better to watch videos, also the notch is very small so that doesn't cover screen. It has triple camera system which helps in focusing and gives amazing shots. This phone is very light weight so its easy and comfortable to carry and because of my hectic schedule I don't get much time to charge the phone, but M30 has super battery of 5000mAh and comes with turbo charger that gives more charging in less time, also it is type-C which is good for mid-range phone.",15 March 2019,5

Samsung does offer best in class service and support which will help a buyers end decision if they plan to use the phone for a long time. Plus the added Samsung brand name may help aid the decision.

This is a wonderful device for a moderate smartphone user who is not a gaming freak. So far, I am quite impressed with its camera, battery backup and voice quality. Camera in certain light conditions, gives quality that matches to One Plus 6, and my Samsung A9. The phone has a vibrant screen and nice textures that makes it quite appealing to masses. Some quick clarification: 1. The phone works on all global networks. Just that it should be activated on an Indian network. 2. The low light camera is just average, if you are a photography freak, better search for another device. 3. Call reception and call quality is above average, though I would not rate it as excellent. 4. Low SAR value, that makes it an excellent buy. 5. No NFC 6. Dual SIM with a separate slot for memory card, expandable upto 256 GB. 7. You may want to get rid of lot of advertisements that bother you if you sign up with Samsung community.",6 April 2019,4

the camera is too good in this price, the mobile display is awesome, every thing is good about it, the battery back up could have been much better.
one more plus point is u can un-install/disable all the useless apps.

Just only one issue came of ads on lock screen after app updation which was promptly solved by custumer care after calling them . As per them third party apps like DILYFIT CALCULATORS PEEL REMOTE AND SOME MORE APPS are responsible for advertisement on lock screen . After uninstalling the dailyfeet app issue solved

Coming to the product, it is a good choice for the price range. It has a decent camera(s). The processor is fast and responsive. Fast face recognition,
good image stability and low light photography is decent with a few glitches. There is a minor heating issue at times. The only negative is the battery life. I have used a phone with 5000 mAH before. It stayed way longer than M30 without the need for charging it. To be precise with this huge a battery size that Samsung claims the performance is not as great as it should be. You will need to charge the battery twice a day with moderate use and no gaming. If you are to use it for PUBG you'll need to charge it more than twice a day. The picture and sound quality are decent as well but Dolby Atmos for sound works only with headphones or a bluetooth speaker.

I think you people copied Oppo/ Vivo which is giving very poor quality images. Hope you will address this case and take necessary action in upcoming models.
And I'm looking for fingerprint on screen rather than bottom of Mobile. And I have seen many of other manufacturers mobile has SMS organizer feature which Samsung doesn't have in any of the models.

I have not got any earphones with mobile which is again bad thing. I may buy outside but I will not feel voice quality and I can not blame earphone or mobile. And now you are sending SMS to win an earphone which is other manufacturers product & giving it to your beloved customers only for 50 numbers.

288,Goa,Excellent Smartphone in price,Display clearity is too good. Has night mode aslo for cutting harmful blue light rays to eyes. Bettry is also good. Rubber back cover also looks stylish if we put on it. I have put Black back cover and one temperd glass total it costed me around Rs200. Weight after putting back cover is also so light. Most important is it dosent heat up on ears while talking. All One plus and other mobile gets heat up on ears while talking. And Samsung service centre you will get easily everywher if any damage occurres when accidentally dropped down or any. And any mobile get drops down somehow in our regular life as we are not that much perfect in handling. Think about your current mobile how many times you have dropped it down.

This is my first Samsung phone I am using and this cannot be comparable with my last phone (Moto G5s Plus). Moto was far better in build quality and other features. I sometimes do regret that why I changed my phone with Samsung.
Cons:
1) Annoying part: While in pocket, the phone open's WhatsApp on it's own, selects a message and sends it to some random contact or sometimes it captures few photos inside my pocket or sometimes it calls someone whom I have never contacted in years. This happens when you set ""Swipe"" as your screen lock. (Double tap to unlock + Swipe) Never faced such issue with Moto with same settings. I miss my Moto. :-(
2) On video call (4G), my phone gets heated near the antenna area. Yani, too much heat.
3) When I shake my phone,(simply) I hear a weird sound above the fingerprint sensor. (something like a lose screw inside).
4) Speaker sound is not as expected.
5) Processor is not at all good. It lags most of the time until you restarts the phone.
6) No slow motion video recording & No EIS.
Pros:
All good except the above 6 points.",22 March 2019,4

293,Kenee,Overall a good one if u aren't all about the performance.,"Finger print scanner works fine but face recognition takes too long to work. Secondly I doesn't have that good performance, if u want powerful performance I recommend u buying redmi note 7 pro. It's been 3 week with this mobile and with my variant (6+128) and many 7-8 games (including pubg, shadow fight 3) it has not hanged or even lagged a single time in the system
U will be getting a ad free Samsung ui.
One thing which is itching me is the android version. I hope they will give a pie update soon as it's running the android oreo.
Coming to camera, Camera is overall very good. With a good selfie camera, u can amazing selfie shots though I wanted them to give all mo mode in video but they haven't so that's in the down side.
Another important thing is it's display and man that's the sexiest display,it looks soo good. And if u r movie marathon guy u are absolutely gonna love this phone with its super amoled display. It's shows black in its purest fork.

Brilliant display, seamless gaming performance(PES), decent camera(smoothens a bit too much for my liking) but the triple cam works well in natural light and for wider output.

Best thing though has to be the battery. I hardly keep the phone down and it still lasts me almost two days. Charges in 2-3 days.

M30 has a big network problem, because it has its own chip, that's not well tested and for avail in low cost phone Samsung ignore that major issue wit the chip of network failure. I am using the phone since one and half month and the problem is the network on this device is not stable in many areas, while using another phone in the same area with same operator work perfectly and the coverage is also fulk but with M30 coverage was not full and internet is not work properly.
2nd is the sount of mobile speaker is too low. You could not hear that loud an clear while you are outside or in home not that loud. So no proper network no proper signal no proper coverage we can't use this phone at all, it is useless because no proper internet access & always carry a headphone if you want to listen properly.",7 June 2019,1

The 4gb ram along with a great processor and indulging display greatly enhances one's gaming and video watching experience. The 64gb internal memory which is expandable upto 512gb makes it impossible to run out of space. The presence of stock Android adds a lot of value. The triple camera makes the photos come to the real life and with the new ultra wide angle feature the whole class can fit into a single frame.

All in All, in this price range, it is quite good.",24 April 2019,3
309,shreya bera,"What a phone, Highly recommend!! Best for this budget segment!!","Let's start by saying I am loving this phone! Three things I love:

1. Build Quality
2. Cameras
3. Performance and Battery

Let's start with the first point, i.e.,
1. Build Quality : The body of this phone is completely made out of plastic but has a good feel to it. It doesn't feel cheap and is solidly built nevertheless.

2. Camera : The Samsung Galaxy M30 has four cameras in total, three at the back and one in the front. The selfies are next level. You can also use AR emoji and beauty modes to enhance your photos.

3. Performance and Battery : ,Gaming is pretty awesome, You can play PUBG at high settings which is the default setting by the way. The 4GB ram also helps alot with multitasking and keeping apps alive in the background. There is 64GB of on board storage but this phone also comes with a dedicated micro sd card slot that supports upto 512GB micro sd cards. So, you don't need to worry about storage at all.
The Battery backup of this phone is insane as it has a 5000mAH battery, it easily lasts you for 2 days or more. This phone also supports fast charging so it will take you very less time to charge it and you don't have to charge it everyday.

What a phone, highly recommend!",15 March 2019,5
310,Amazon Customer,M30 - go for it..its value for money,M30 is a great phone with latest configuration and security features. The battery back up with normal usage went on for more than 48 hours and with heavy usage went upto 30+ hours. The camera quality is good and different modes are easy to operate. Overall a good buy.,26 March 2019,5
311,Somnath Sutar,Great Camera but Poor Battery Life,I am using this Mobile Since Last 8 Days and I had Purchased for 5000 mah Battery but Its Battery Life is Worst.. It drains within a Day.. And Lots of Mobile Hanging issue with Processor... Processor is Very Poor.. Mobile Hangs for 2 - 3 Application. Very Disappointed by Samsung.,19 March 2019,4
312,Surya Saravanan,"Bad CPU, Bad Camera! Buy only for dispaly!","Bad camera...triple camera is as good as dual....not a performer, Snapdragon 675 in Xiaomi RN7Pro gives 170K+ in antutu along with IMX586 sensor for extreme camera performance...buy this phone only for Super Amoled display as this is the cheapest Amoled option!",25 March 2019,2
313,Ishita Modak,Not bad for normal usage ( not for game lovers),"I have been using this phone for almost 1 month ....and in this period i've discovered some good and bad qualities of the phone....first let me come to the good things about this phone....
1. Battery and charging : battery lasts very long....with a normal usage (youtube, facebook,whatsapp...everything necessary....only except gaming) it gives a backup of 1day 17 hours.... i.e almost 2 days.... and the fast charger given inside the box charges the phone fully (starting from 10%) within 2 hours....
2. Display : it allows 1080p video watching....
3.Camera: it is quite satisfactory...in the daylight...the picture quality (with out live focus mode....i.e. background blur) is stunning....and when background blur is on...picture quality is quite good....and it is not very much aggessive ....and it can also be adjusted manually after the capture....selfie camera is also very nice which comes with a screen flash....but low light photography doesn't give much detailing of the photo....at night both the cameras are so so....
4.Performane : for a regular usage performance is sufficient .... there is also option for miltitusking....2 apps can be opened at the same time....
Now the bad ones are.... (although i don't know whether these are the problem of this particular set or not..)
1. Face recognition : every now and then it cannot recognize the registered face...and some times it takes 3-4 sec. to do it...
2.Fingerprint sensor: doesn't unlock in a moment all the time . Sometimes takes 2 - 3 sec.
3. Earphone : no earphone is there inside the box.",29 April 2019,4
314,Good-To-Go.,A product worth buying for long term use.,"Everything about this phone is superb. DISPLAY- CAMERA - BATTERY - AWESOME.
thanks to its Super AMOLED display, triple camera setup and massive 5,000mAh battery.
Now after the latest update of ANDROID PIE, the phone has become super smooth. The 1.8GHz octa-core Exynos 7904 chipset deserves a mention here.
I am a heavy gamer and also drive around 9 hrs per day using the phone GPS and Google maps. At the end of the day I don't find it necessary to recharge it.
The quick charger included with the phone is super efficient to charge upto 50% in 30 minutes.
The use of Finger print reader is brilliant. Now I never have to key in my password everytime for logging in and checking out . My one finger print helps me in dozens of daily transactions across several sites and this is amazing using only my fingerprint.
The Camera setup too is good especially the wide angle lens, the HQ photos and videos also do not require lot of space for storage. (higher the camera MP higher the picture MB)
My M30 is strong and powerful enough to last with me for next 10 years and I will recommend it for everyone.",26 April 2019,5
315,Gaurav Jindal,Good phone overall.,"After using the phone for few months now, I will give it 3.5 stars.

Pro:
Good battery life for normal user.
Okay-ish charging speed.
Great looks.
UI looks cool too.
Wide angle camera photos are awesome. Even selfies and normal photos are good. Low light photography suffers a bit.
Face unlock feature is very fast and accurate too.

Cons
Fingerprint sensor is too slow.
Samsung's OS features like searching lags a bit.
Flash light is not so powerful and hence low light photographs are not good.

All and all good stylish phone. MI phones might be better than it in this range but for those who don't like to go for those companies (like me) this is a decent enough phone. You can get value for money.",20 June 2019,4
316,Sunil,Best budget smartphone,"I am absolutely impressed by the stunning display of the smartphone. Another impressive quality is its battery life....believe me once you charge the phone upto 100% and it will easily last for more than 24 hrs even if you use it extensively for 8-10 hrs. Though the processor is not at par with the competition but it does a good job in handling the phone. I have been using it for roughly 3 months now and personally I haven't encountered any major lag. Camera quality is good though the wide angle camera resolution could have been better, but still it's a nice bargain at this price. Overall, the smartphone is best suited for those people who do not care much about the phone specifications and just want to have a friendly device which can serve all the major functions of a modern era with ease. Also, hats off to SAMSUNG for finally reacting to the need of a proper budget smartphone and also for delivering timely android updates unlike the previous samsung phones in this price range.",18 June 2019,5

Talking about the battery life - It runs for almost 2 days with heavy usage especially when I play my favourite Pubg game. It doesn't even lag either which in return enhances my gaming experiance. I love streaming HD videos on Netflix and the clarity is phenominal. Talking about the camera, it captures beautiful images which can be easily compared to photos clicked on DSLR. The charcoal colour which I picked is the best and it has 64GB memory inbuild which helps me store all photos and videos. It's a great buy for everyone and I love it.",11 March 2019,5
325,Liesl DAbreo,Worth it!,"The Samsung Galaxy M30 is a unique phone alone by its body having a gradient finish to it.

The ultra wide angle camera captures the entire picture in detail, and it’s supported by its auto focus. It also supports 4K video recording. The 16 MP front camera makes it ideal for taking the best selfies. In addition to the 128 GB internal storage, it can be extended up to 512GB. The Octo Core processor along with the 6GB of RAM makes the phone a ideal phone for heavy applications that work with extremely smoothly. The Processor and RAM also makes it’s a really good phone for Gaming especially for games like PUBG and Asphalt 9.

Reading, browsing internet and watching videos is more pleasing experience on a bigger screen. The Face Recognition feature is so quick and effortlessly stylish. Slimmer phones are easier to carry and look more fashionable. Use multiple sims at the same time. It allows you to use two services without the need to carry two mobiles at the same time. Touch Displays offer a more interactive experience. Camera features are great and they offer image stabilization which really helps as I travel a lot and requirement is high, pictures in low light also come out pretty great. Overall, it's got new and exciting features some of which include face unlock, a gyroscope and a compass which makes using the phone fun and enjoyable!",14 March 2019,5

This phone's screen doesn't have any sort of protection. I have other phones having gorilla protection and they get dropped pretty often by my kids and they are still fine. Please remember that if you are buying a Samsung phone then do buy an insurance to cover your screen as it's gonna break like a fragile glass. If possible go for Xiaomi, redmi who are offering gorilla protection even on low range phones. I did a big mistake buying this phone. Should have gone for Redmi note 7 pro",20 March 2019,1

Good looking device and feels good in hand. Though the size is big can be comfortably hold in one hand with out slippery.
I'm Not much into gaming, but very decent performance for everyday use.
Display is brilliant. But Auto Bright sensor is not upto the mark.
Primary & Depth sensor camera is very good and wide angle sensor could ave been much better, image looks very distorted even in normal view. Front camera performance is good
No Heat issue.
Battery backup comes upto 2 days in normal use with Mobile Data+ Wi Fi always on. With heavy use like navigation, Bluetooth calling, Audio the battery backup easily lasts up to 1 day.
Device takes upto 1 hr to charge completely.",30 April 2019,4
331,Purushottam Patil,"Class Product by Samsung , worst packaging from amazon","I ordered this product for my Mother. There was nothing to protect phone other than a Amazon carry bag.Product can be damaged easily. Also, sim slot was bended..
Pros:-
1) Premium Amoled screen and Back is also awesome.. Don't trust the reviews stating that it looks cheap..No, it looks premium.
2) Camera is quiet good..Better than what people say in review.
3) There is no lag in device functioning.
4)Handy and stylish.
5)Charging is very fast.
Cons-
1) Device is delicate so Case cover is must.
2) Not so loud speakers unlike Chinese plastic phones I.e. oppo,vivo,mi

332,Sahil Sharma,Satisfactory,"Overall a good phone with a decent camera. Difference between a 4gb or 6gb RAM is hard to tell as such. I faced a few problems before the android 9.0 update, the phone was pretty slow but have been working fine post that.
What I like about the phone is it's looks, sleek and blue comes in a dual shade which gives it a classy look. The camera is good. And the screen resolution is great too. The battery life is too good for a Samsung but again I have been using the phone for just 2 months with an average usage.
The face recognition lock is pretty slow and there are a few lags in the camera application and while uninstalling the apps.
Overall I would recommend buying the phone for this range because of the looks and the features overall.",18 June 2019,4

Phone is bit heavy coz of 5000mah battery but its understandable.
Security is awesome like face unlock n fingerprint n pattern etc so much secure.
Display is crisp for this price.
Camera 3 in back n dot moycg display is oomph factor.

334,Serin MJ,Just Loved it.,"Just loved using M30. Samsung offered a budget but no compromise in quality for M30, that's what i felt after using it for a while.
1, Display : SuperAMOLED, that I've never seen in this price range, the difference between LCD and Samsung's SuperAMOLED is incomparable. The black is the perfect black, and each and every colour is crisp in SuperAMOLED. And thereby offering the Best visual experience and low power consumption. And also the display is bit bigger than most phones at this range, which is a good thing.
2, Battery life : 5000 mAh, more than enough. For an average user* it lasts 1day and a few more hours.(*depending on our use)
Gameplay, If you are an average gamer, this is for you. But if u need high graphics and smooth gameplay in games like pubg, asphalt etc, this phone is not fully recomended, But still, M30 is good for gaming. For the first time i played pubg in M30. Using gfx tool games like pubg can be played smoothly. So that part is solved.

And still the phone is light weight.

3, Camera : A Triple camera setup at this price range is awesome, the ultra wide angle cam is the special one with an average clarity. But the primary 13 MP and depth cam 5MP does the job perfectly.
The 16 MP selfy cam performance is also good even in low light* ( but the clarity varies with the light )
4, Sound : M30 offers High quality Dolby Atmos audio experience while using headphones, for both Music and Videos.
5, User Interface or UI : SAMSUNG'S One UI is the best, simple and peaceful interface in my view.
6, Fingerprint reader : Not only for unlocking the phone fast and safe, but it can also be used to scroll down the notification panel easily by dragging finger up to down on the fingerprint reader.
( Not seen in any other phone )
7, Sim and Memory card slot : there is a dedicated slot for 2 sim cards and 1 memory card, this specification is not seen in many phones.
8, Notification light : no specific led for notification but the flash light led or screen dimming can be enabled as notification light.",20 June 2019,5
335,Ujjwal Malik,Best buy under 15k,"I am writing this review after using M30 4GB variant for 5 days. Display quality is amazing. I watched a lot of online reviews before purchasing M30 and wasn't sure about camera quality but found it much better those reviews. Front cam is very nice and Rear cam also gives you nice clicks. Only low light photography is average. Sound quality is also very good. Louder than Redmi note7 pro. Battery backup of 1.5 days for average user like me who is not in heavy gaming. No hanging or heating issues. Curved design feels premium in hand. Dual Volte is good experience. Fingerprint and face recognition
sensors work nicely. Overall much better experience than what YouTube reviews told.",16 April 2019,5

The only slight drawback is its performance with respect to gaming....
The Exynos processor just works fyn with PUBG...at low fps
One more setback is that it works on android 8.1 oreo (Samsung will come with its pie update maybe by the end of the year)..

Go for it
I'll suggest 6gb/128gb.
I have been using it for more than 2 months.
I have 10 GB of different games but it doesn't affect the phone.
I have every social media app and all runs smoothly.
Processing power of the phone is really nice.
A phone with awesome battery life.
Cool graphics, beautiful screen and good looking mobile phone.
You can not get a better branded phone in this range.
Better camera than all the phones in this range. Better than all oppo/vivo phones below 20k. I can assure that the depth sensitive of M30 is better than oneplus5t.

Cons-
There is no inbuilt applock (does not matter)
Default setting in pubg is not so smooth so you have to put it on low mode (still HD).
Inbuilt game recorder is there but recording pubg creates frame drop if you play on HD.

Face unlock is real fast but not really secure.
Fingerprints works at lightening speed.",21 May 2019,5
344,Amazon Customer,Best Value-For-Money Device from a Big Brand like SAMSUNG,"First of all, I'm a loyal SAMSUNG Guy; I can't use OPPO/VIVO because of their User Interface. Prior to M30 I have used J7!!! Thats why I was very upset when I heard SAMSUNG wont give OneUI to M-Series, but it didn't happen; SAMSUNG shocked everyone by giving OneUI to its Millennium series...

1.sAMOLED Display under 15k: I Can't Use a Phone that doesn't have OLED Panel !!!
2.Huge 5000mAH Battery: Phone lasts atleast 2 days with normal usage.
3.Supports HD streaming: I'm a Netflix User.
4.Dedicated card slot: I'm a guy who uses 2 SIM's with a SD Card in it.
5.USB Type-C port and fast charging that charges phone in just approximately 1 hour.",18 June 2019,4
345,Mukesh selvam,Galaxy m30 is really fantastic.,"Galaxy M30 is a great phone For the great budget, you get an AMOLED screen, better selfies, better connectivity (dual-band Wi-Fi), and a better portrait mode for the rear camera.You can record videos of beautiful moments, sceneries and watch them later.
Triple camera is useful in enhancing certain effects like blur, zoom and wide angle photos.
More cores result in better parallelism, meaning more tasks can be processed in parallel without slowing down the User Interface thats because of the insane ram. Time to beat everyone while playing PUBG ;)
It has a Gyroscope that determines orientation and rotation and provides more accurate 3D motion tracking than an accelerometer. All in all a power pack phone within the budget, I'd definetly recommend this phone.",16 March 2019,5
346,Viral jani,The phone is must buy .,"Phone is too good and being Samsung M series it has to be impressive.Ram being 4GB is good enough for a person like me and 64 gb storage is more than needed for me.front and back camera both are proper and pictures I clicked, are really nice. Charging is not getting drained like before used phones so impressed with it and gets charged quickly within some time. 1.8 GHz processor is appreciated. Supports 4g which is the best part. Android system 8.1 i.e Oreo version is already available.At once 2 sim cards can be used so happy for it. Since I'm using Samsung it's always a happy moment for me. It's light weighted
so it's always a plus point. Display is really very good and very sensitive. I'd give a 5/5 for Samsung M30",12 March 2019,5

What kind of quality inspection Samsung does before packing the phone. There is nothing being displayed even though I know that the phone is charged and on, the display is dead. Didn't expect this from Samsung and Amazon India.
And now when tech inspection is done, Amazon is saying they can't replace and forcing me to take a refund and on the other hand conducting another flash sale but they don't have it for replacement.",2 April 2019,1
348,Ananth,Decent phone overall,"Pros
Amazing display at this price point, 2 day battery backup on moderate to heavy usage, super light for 5000mah battery phone.

Cons
Average cameras, poor low light performance, graphic intensive games dont play smooth, very slow finger print sensor- takes 2 seconds to detect, akward placement of the sensor placed higher than regular phones.
The most annoying thing however is the spammy ads that pop up everytime. I tried scanning through various malware/adware detectors but couldn't spot any rogue app.

353,Naveen K.,Not working in weak Mobile signal as compare to Samsung On Max and J2Pro (2016),"I have buy this product because of Brand reputation but did not come up to my expectation as compare to other samsung mobile I am using as Samsung On Max and J2 Pro (2016). Not working in Weak Signal as compare to other phone, everytime disconnected and have to manually configuring it, usually I used maximum for Internet. Front Camera is good but Rear camera is inferior. FingerPrint reader, Face Recognition and Battery is excellent. Overall built and function is good as Processing speed, Loudspeaker, HD screen and video quality.

358,SOUMYADEEP SARKAR,"Samsung M30, an honest review!","Well, first of all, thanks Amazon for this fast delivery! Got it in time! Now, moving on to the phone itself, It fits well in the sub 15k budget range, giving you good performance, battery life, decent camera with a very good AMOLED Screen. Now, previously I have been using MI A1, which was also a very good mobile with Stock android, to be honest, I was a bit terrified to see Lockscreen ads in this device, however, update to android pie removed the issue. So, please update to android 9 just after getting the device. Fingerprint is decent as well, I was having some trouble first, however now, it is good. Camera is very good as well. Atleast a notch higher than my previous experience! Images are crispy, good and have enough sharpness in them. However, low light imaging is not a very strong factor of this device. You will get ok photos in low light. Another reason I chose M30 was the big battery backup and it did not let me down. It sure is good, and lasts more than one day. So, if you are an average user, go for this device as it feels good and premium in your hands!",16 June 2019,5
359,John Robert Irudhayaraj,Worst Battery Backup,Worst Battery Backup!!! Raised a complaint regarding that and got fabulous response stating that Only 6 hrs battery backup.. Pls put your phone in Airplane Mode for battery backup ad described in product description.. No response from Samsung or Amazon.

Well done..!!,21 April 2019,1
360,Prem Kulkarni,A great mobile phone,"The Samsung Galaxy M30 has a gorgeous AMOLED screen and looks just awesome from the front. The front camera resides in a U-shaped notch, which is inconsequentially smaller than the V-shaped notch on the Galaxy M20 and M10.If you ask me, I quite like the software experience on the Galaxy M30, and it definitely gives M30 an edge over Xiaomi, Realme, and Vivo phones. And yes, unlike most phones in this segment, the Galaxy M30 can stream HD content from Netflix and Amazon Prime.Compared to the M20, the Galaxy M30 adds a third camera sensor to sweeten the pot. This extra unit is a depth sensor that makes the live focus mode so much better. I'm in love with this model.",17 March 2019,5
361,Rajiv S M,"Camera quality is disappointing, Good Battery","Brought the phone for the promised camera quality. - The quality of wide angle photos are very poor. Poor low light photography. The photo quality is nothing like what they have shown in the sample.

362,Annu,One of the best phones I've ever laid my hands on.,"The Samsung M30 comes with a 6.40 inch touchscreen display and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. This power packed device with a 5000 mAH supports fast charging and is powered by a 1.6 GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor that features 2 cores clicked at 1.8GHz and 6 cores clocked at 1.6Ghz and 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage. This device runs on Android 8.1 Oreo and packs 3 rear cameras (13, 5 And 5 megapixel each) and a 16 megapixel front facing selfie camera for perfect selfie shots. In my personal opinion this phone is a win win when it comes to value of money and great features.",14 March 2019,5
363,Poonam,Waste of time and money,"Camera is very bad, images taken from phone is very blur and color shades are very different from actuals. It's 16MP but very poor quality of pictures, even 12 MP photo is very good infort of 16MP camera Pic.
Now a days our phone work as our camera and we use it for every work and never carry cameras, but I am disappointed with this product where I had spent 14k ok mobile.
And very worst thing is I am not able to return as well on Amezone as it's new phone in market.
Badly wasted my hard earn money.

Couple of days back I had connected my mobile to bluetooth headset for the whole day and at eveng while i was on call it all of sudden started restarting continuously. It almost kept restarting for 15mins and for PUBG fans its 100% BIG FAT NO. Game doesn't run on this mobile . So i would say better not to go for this mobile.",30 June 2019,3

368,Anil Vasista,Faulty speaker system - sounds like a local assembly from Samsung,"I liked everything (not overall) - 5 stars for that.
I am not sure if this is a defect with particular handset, but my unit is defective. The audio is unclear, feels like there is a moving part inside near the ear piece (little tap gives you vibration inside.).
Back panel is faded on top in a month's time. Not sure if this is a feature or a defect. Functioning of phone is not altered though.
WORST of all is the return policy. I have been using Samsung Only phones for nearly a decade and I get this raw deal. When I try to return the phone (remember i paid for a quality handset not a defective one), i cannot proceed without providing details of a credit card, that I used overseas, 10 yrs ago and which has expired. Spoke to the customer service guy from SAMSUNG, who JUST said, go to a local store and get it repaired. Unless SAMSUNG proves me wrong with respect to their quality and UX, rest assured, will not buy another unit from SAMSUNG. I was interested to evaluste and gift one for my father who turns 80 this July as the phone is really good.
I feel let down, for all the interest I showed in waiting for the auction and encouraging a new model and buying it. I feel I wasted my hard earned money. Please visit a store instead of buying from AMAZON, who also let me down with their 'insensitive/ impractical' policy for returns. Not the first time with Amazon though - may be my 'another chance' attitude needs refinement. THANK YOU.",9 June 2019,3
369,Iftakhar Ahamad,I trust on amazon.,"Amazon delivered the mobile on time but it was hanging again and again. It was unresponsive when hanged, nothing happen, no switch off, no response from device. Finally I order for replacement, thanks to amazon for this great feature.
Got second device within 2-3 days and it works great, no hangs. I think first was defective item delivered to me.
Finally thanks to amazon",22 June 2019,5
370,Dr Ramakrishna,Perfect analytical review of M30.,"The most amazing feature of the phone is the screen and the display. The front camera notch is perfectly placed and it's very concised. The bezels are perfect. The battery life is ecstatic. I have played watched videos on YouTube for atleast an hour with only 7 percent of battery. Once I hadn't charged for almost 2 days and still with a lot of usage I still had 10 to 15 percent of battery charge left. The camera quality is amazing, both front and the back camera but the only drawback is that you have to compromise a little on the picture quality in a low light environment. Other than that the camera is great especially the wide angle picture quality is marvellous. The speed of the phone is actually great. Honestly, I have never experienced any lags so far, even while playing games like pubg which require a high processing speed. The design is the phone is literally jaw-dropping, that's the only way I can explain that. The fingerprint scanner works very well and it's fast roo but the only drawback is that your fingers should be quite clean. The user interface and the Dolby atmos feature is really good. ALL IN ALL SAMSUNG GALAXY M30 AT THIS PRICE SEGMENT IS A STEAL😉",18 June 2019,5

The battery, camera(in daylights), Front camera, seems to be working fine and it's good for this price range. What I don't like is the touch sensibility, the sound delivery. The touch sensibility is not that great sometimes and the sound quality is very low especially when you are watching YouTube, Netflix etc. The voice reception during calls is good. There is no slow motion option in the camera section which is a little disappointing. I am not a big fan of games so did not bother much on that. Overall a average phone in this price range.",11 May 2019,3
373,Deependra singh,Almost Perfect 😍,"After searching for an entire eternity, found this phone - Samsung Galaxy M30 and I couldn't believe the price! Thanks Samsung for looking out for fellows like me! Can you believe that you're getting 3X features phone under 18K??

The marvellous display caught my attention like no otherphone the Super AMOLED FHD+ Infinity U Display of this phone with a screen size of 16.21cm (6.4"") gives you the best visuals ever, with vibrant colours and sharp contrast! And you can view all the content in HD as this phone is enabled with the widevine L1 feature.
The juiced-up battery and fast charging features are like every tech lover's dream!
Guys, let's face it - low battery is the most heart-breaking thing to see when you are out, This new phone is equipped with a 3X fast charging feature and it comes with a 15W charger., this phone runs on a 5000 mAh battery, so, binge-watch shows or play games on the go without worrying about your phone's battery getting exhausted.

it has a super battery saver with three modes and can make your phone work the entire day with a 10% battery charge..so all in all a real good deal at this price..watching movies in a 6.4 inch screen with full HD+ view alongwith total screen view is a wonder.....",18 June 2019,5

I have found some Apps getting hanged or slow down, but then, I dont use them much. The ones I use, like Avia Video Player, YuuTube, IG, Twitter/facebook, they work very well and never crashed so far!
I use jio SIM and use this phone as hotspot for my laptop. Last two days.

380,Neeraj Anand,SAMSUNG DAYS ARE GONE !!,"Guys, Samsung days are gone now. Dont buy these phones.

I bought this phone with alot of hassles because of sale event product. I bought 6/128 version.
Some major issues with phone-

Poor fingerprint reader.

Bad camera quality.

Phone has a lot of lag. Very slow screen transitions.

App store problem, apps doesn't update even with auto update. I called and try to get it solved by customer care, tyey told me to format the device, due which i lost all data.

Very slow phone. You literally have to wait for 5-10 seconds after opening play store.

what is the use of 6gb ram when ph is so slow.

But only good thing is battery and large screen with no embazzle.

THATS IT GUYS!! BUY MI POCO or used Oneplus instead you'll be far happier.

Dont buy guys!! Samsung is not able to give quality products now.",18 May 2019,2
381,Sonia,MySamsung M30 review,"I love the fact first of all that Samsung is very user friendly ...also its a very budget friendly phone which gives you specs that are very efficient in a price that is affordable.
The 5000 MAH battery is the biggest pull for me it lasts a good day half two days after extensive usage.
The phone is not a hybrid ..thank god!! it has two sim slots as well as memory card slot which is very important because if it were a hybrid it would mean it would come with some constraints as there would be one less slot...so I prefer it to be as it is as I can use both my SIM cards in the phone and have an extended storage capability which goes up to 512 GB . The cameras r ok as they r obviously cameras that r in budget I am still trying to figure them out....lol...
What's most impressive in this phone for me is it's user friendliness and all the little Samsung apps that come along with it .....i didn't have to spend much time figuring stuff out and u can easily move stuff from Ur internal storage to Ur SD card if u wanna free up space some many more things like fingerprint scanner face recognition......etc..... all in all it's value for money I have rotated around quiet a few mobile brands these last couple of years.....but I'm glad I'm back with Samsung ......🥰",18 June 2019,5

I was using Mi max2 and that was a good deal but somehow I had to give it my younger cousin who was going to USA for stay. The fone was impressive looking and I like it but as I started using it, started missing my mi max. The battery was good but it seems there is a bug in it. The video doesn't run continually and same with video camera. It seems broken signal problem. I updated the software on schedule but problem persists still. The worst part is the taking screen shot. It has traditionally concept fone, pressing 2buttons simultaneously and what mi max had 3fingers magical faceoff movie touch and shot is saved. I am looking forward to see new feature fone from them.

@Speed: It is completely standing on expectation as it has 6 GB ram which makes all the process super fast.

@Screen: Size of screen is perfect and resolution is good. For keep care of your eyes it also gives blue filter.

@Battery Life: I really amazed and love this most, In simpler uses I charge the phone in 2 days. If you are fed up with your draining battery then this is perfect choice for you.

@Camera Quality: There is three back camera which gives you opportunity to click wider frame. But quality of pic is not like S8 or S10.

@Front Camera: Front camera is very powerful and will give you satisfactory photographs.

@Charging: It comes with fast charger and get charged quickly.

@Weight: Phone weight is ok and wont irritate you.

I am using the 4 + 64GB version in blue and it works just so well!!
I am very happy with my device and recommend it to everyone looking for something in the price range.
The 50000 mAh battery is just so helpful and very rare in mobiles, with normal usage on Wifi I get upto 3 full days of battery backup!
And also you can fully charge the phone with the fast charger from 0 to 100 in just 2-3 hrs!
The features are just unlimited and the device feels actually premium to use.
An added feature of Samsung is that the phone damage can be repaired almost anywhere you are and it won't even cost you much.
Plus Samsung is both, durable and reliable, even with the 4GB RAM I can play games with a lot of clarity!
The device also doesn't heat up!
The screen is vivid and almost every setting can be customized very easily and effectively for every person.
The Samsung in-built apps might seem like a burden, but if you turn off the notifications, they're really helpful in gaming and multitasking!
I have never experienced any system error in this device, if I have got any, it is due to some error I made, for which I was helped by the Samsung online chat service step by step.
Samsung phones also have many many in-built features like antivirus, automatic cache memory cleaner and device booster that improve the performance of the product.
With smart view one can connect easily to almost any TV set for screen mirroring. And the camera quality is just so cool! I don't even need to search for wallpapers, I can easily just take out my phone, look for a scene I like and click!
Whatever I say is less, this phone is a must buy!
The best choice ever!!",20 June 2019,5
396,Aditya Rathi,Worst Rear Camera for indoor photos,"Worst when it comes to image stabilisation. Indoor and low light photos are useless. Outdoor and brightly light room pics are decent. Battery is average. Camera app needs a lot of improvement - not sure how dual or triple camera works as you cannot adjust background after clicking photos whereas Nokia has that feature inbuilt as it snaps the reference of dual camera which holds the feature of adjusting background even after the photo is clicked.

Made a wrong choice considering 15k price was expecting better camera performance.

Other features are ok.",15 April 2019,1

398,RC,Overall great phone,"Phone is very good considering its price range for a 6GB RAM and 128 GB internal memory. Camera is decent and its a great buy at this price point. No lagging or freezing. All seems great as of now.

Amazon delivery was fast anf the product arrived decently packed and ahead of delivery schedule.

Overall satisfied.",12 March 2019,5
399,Amazon Customer,The perfect package you were looking for!!,"Well, Samsung m30 comes as a pleasant surprise from Samsung whose earlier budget smartphones were not that good. Battery life is where this phone beats every competition it has, it easily lasts 2 days on an average usage and on intensive usage it lasts 1.5 days. The fast charger is another advantage this phone has.
The AMOLED screen is just a cherry on top
Amazing screen clarity and that infinity U notch looks amazing.
The triple camera setup is simply amazing for all the camera freaks.
The phone ticks all the boxes since it has USB C-type but it doesn't miss out on a 3.5mm jack.
The one UI is one of the smoothest and efficient UIs from Samsung.
Dolby Atmos takes the headphone experience to another level.
AMOLED helps to save a lot of battery.
Cons
The plastic back doesn't feel as premium to hold onto and is a fingerprint magnet.
You might need to install some third party apps for additional features that come as standard in Xiaomi aur Huawei devices.
The speaker ks adequate but not as good as the competition.
There are no lags in gaming and multi tasking but this phone doesn't fare as good as redmi note 7 pro in gaming and editing.
The fingerprint reader is adequate and fast but the reader on Xiaomi devices is much faster",18 June 2019,4
400,Amazon Customer,Good phone at this price,"What I liked:
The display is really nice..totally worth the money. The charging is also fast ..
6 gb ram ensures it practically never hangs ( I dont game on it, just multitask basic things)

What coud be better:
The sound is not loud enough.
Rear camera could have been 16mp instead of 13.
16mp front camera is overkill if u ask me. ( I dont take selfies)

Overall great bang for your buck! For general use and casual photography ill
highly recommend this phone!",22 April 2019,5
401,V B.,Got what i wanted,"A great phone with features what i was looking out for. My needs were
Good battery
Dedicated memory card slot
Double SIM
Reasonable camera for outdoors and selfies with friends
Good RAM and internal storage
Reasonably good processor.
Good display
Ease of use - good UI
Samsung Galaxy M30 ticked all my above requirements and is a great companion. I can down load as many apps without fear of space. I am not a gamer so processing speed is fine for my browsing requirement. Now upgraded to Android Pie. Very happy with the buy.",6 June 2019,5

The 5000mah battery is exceptional.The AMOLED screen is a delight for eyes.But there are shortcomings.Software is just Oreo.The processor speed is just average and gamers would be disappointed.The camera also seems average.The placement of speakers at the bottom often let the sound get blocked by hand.The face lock opens with eyes closed.Despite all that,the phone is smooth and great for day to day usage.",26 April 2019,5

Battery life they have mentioned first charging but i have tested it's fake not really first charging as usual Samsung provides charging facilities earlier. Look at Oneplus brands they are really awesome. I feel that I've wasted my money, if I could have used same money and buy other home materials my money would have been used for better products.

405,SAKTHI BHUVANESH KUMAR,Feel of a flagship @ less than 20k,"Overall, this is an ok ok purchase. Got it for 17999 (6 + 128 variant). Prior to this, I was using redmi 5 and I would say, my old phone outperforms this in some areas. The chipset in this phone is exynos, which is not exactly the best when others have snapdragon. The phone does not feature an IR blaster, nor the package includes any covers (something redmi phones at lesser price always do). The battery 5000 mAh Li-Poly, which is not exactly a power house and is comparable to 3300 or 4000 mAh li ion. Fingerprint is a little laggy when compared to other phones at the same price range and is slower than redmi 5 I bought an year ago.having said that, I still like the very Samsung features such as the LED display, voice quality and gradient design.",25 June 2019,4

409,vishal wagh,Masterpiece from Samsung,"Pros :
1.Superb display: with super amoled panel, very vibrant and also contains blue light filter to protect your eyes.
2. Great sound quality: bottom rocker is great and have quite crispy and clear sound.
3. Battery backup: trust me this is one of the best phones to have battery backup, with 5000 mAh battery and a fast charger included in box, it lasts easily upto 1.5 days.
4. Camera : the 13 megapixel sensor does good in outdoor and good lighting conditions, the wide angle shot is amazing.
5. Samsung service: you get stable and established brand to use with low SAR value and very good after sales service.
6. Extra memory card slot: you can expand your memory via micro sd card along with having 2 sim card simultaneously.
7. Super value for money: just 15k for samsungs super amoled display.
8. Always on display: its just awesome, the way you get to know the notifications without touching the phone, its really helpfull if you have this phone as primary phone.
9. Face unlock: the face unlock is supreme on this phone , as well the line of light glows continuously on the notch till it detects face.
10. Amazon service: superb packaging and rapid delivery.

Cons:
1. Polycarbonate back: bit fingerprint magnet also quite slippery.
2. Processor: weak as compared to sd 675, but equally well equipped to as sd636.
3. Optimisation and extra features: no ir blaster, also the UI skin is not that good.
4. Fingerprint reader: its a bit slow, not quite everytime unlocks in fraction of a second.",25 May 2019,5
410,Anurag,Loving it so far.,"Pros:
> Display is very cool. On par with flagship phones.
> Battery life is great.
> Camera quality is fair, comparing it with previous generation samsung phones.
> Touch is very smooth. Much smoother than the competition redmi note 7 pro. And also a better display than the same.
> fast charger is included in the box!
> Widevine L1 certified, so you can watch shows and youtube videos in HD.
> really good fast charging. Goes from 10 to 100 percent in 2 hours, and then lasts 2 days with moderate usage. Even a quick 10 minutes charge will help you keep your phone alive for the rest of your day.
> triple camera setup with a wide angle lens for great landscape pictures.

Cons
> processor not powerful enough. Not a good choice for hardcore gamers. But you can play games on low quality.
> night camera is okayish. Could have been better.
> no 4k video, not even 60fps option in the videos, so there is no slowmo either.
> Aspect ratio is a bit odd. Videos are slighty zoomed in on apps. Even instagram stories are slightly zoomed in to fit on screen. There must be a way to change it but I have yet to discover the setting.
> No gorilla glass and polycarbonate back. Both sides are prone to scratches.

But it if:
You are a student and spend a lot of time on phone studying and taking notes.
If you want to watch shows online and youtube in good quality.
If you want a phone that lasts long (in terms of battery).

Don't buy if you want a high-performance phone.

Rating: 8/10. The phone is good for its price. You won't get this display at this price in any other phone. The battery and fast charging are a nice addition.",28 April 2019,5
411,Bejoy,Good Buy,"Its a good buy from Sam.Pls fit a real ambient light sensor as the vertual one is pathetic in my experience.Also why no Pie out of box ? , Because you want to update it later for the namesake and forget about Q ?
SD660 or a better exynos would have been a much better option.SAM you are finally doing good , but you can do better and tale on the Chinies !",22 March 2019,5
412,Arnav Gupta,Great Package,This phone is much better option for the people who don't play heavy games in their mobile phones. And This is a great package as you also getting super Amoled Display in this phone and processor of this device is much better than its lower model like M10 and M20. You also get fast charger with this and back of this device is great. You can surely go for this phone if you want a phone in 15k range. But if you will be able to spend 5k more then you can also go for higher models like A50 or Poco F1 etc.,13 April 2019,5
413,Naga Balaji,big batter SLOW PROCESSOR,"The only thing you hate about this mobile is that, the slowness, you find slowness each every apps you open or even while using Google maps, I'm not pubg gamer, but I use Google maps a lot.

Surely you will feel irritated when you are in hurry to open and use apps.

Reg, battery life it is amazing, a non gamer will at least 24 hours of battery life.

Camera is pretty good.

Face unlock will be slow but faster than S9+ ( which I should not compare, since S series have been flagship models)

Finger print is not disappointing.

VERDICT : The SLOWNESS, is the biggest disappointment. However, the battery life is pretty compromising, you have HEATing issue when MOBILE DATA is ON.
Let's hope this phone doesn't slows down after a year.",22 June 2019,3

417,Akshay,A perfect phone at a practical price!,"Got this phone around a month ago. My earlier phone was moto g5s plus. I am a moderate user of phone who keeps on hanging with internet and all the required essential apps, I also play games at times.

Now what good about m 30 for me is:
1. Premium software quality with no ads.
2. Excellent display.
3. Better performance compared to my moto phone. This was where I surprised even though on papers this phone has not very powerful processors but still it gives it's best when comes to background app management. I have not felt any heating issues or lag issues even after using heavy apps for hours!
4. Good front camera.
5. Excellent battery life . Comes around 2.5 days for me.

Some cons:
1. Even though primary camera is good. But does not give it's best in low light.
2. Yes its software is premium with ad free but i was expecting Samsung UI 1 which is available in A series.
3. Speaker could have been amplified more.

Overall a very practical phone which gives u a premium feel especially due to its display.

Many people compare this with redmi note 7 pro. I agree note 7 pro is a good phone which has better processor but you cannot feel the same premium experience as m 30 here is why:
1. Just compare the both display!
2. Check out note 7 apps filled with full ads.
3. Even though they claim 48 mp it's not always! it it gives u in pro mode with no zoom option.
4 microphone and headset audio of m 30 is better.
5. Note 7 is a perfect phone for teen agers who is more intrested in gaming or heavy usage. M 30 is for professional and moderate users who are more intrested in quality for primary usage of phone.",20 June 2019,4

Now about camera, triple camera has do good job beautifull picture quality bokeh and portrait mode and another option in their its ultra wide angle that's very cool,u can capture group photos and hills nature with a complete scene I love it but slow motion function is missing this is sad.Fingerprint and face unlock recognation is very quick and smart u can get more opt to do more by fingerprint sensor like sliding photos and tool bar etc. No heating issues at all on heavy gaming like pubg. Fast charging is perfect. And phone having type c USB that also good. Having polycarbonate body and glossy touch body in double shades and over all to say is Value for money.",18 June 2019,4
420,Ankit Kumar,Amazing Phone,"I am using this phone from 17 March 2019 and I was one of the first and foremost customers. I was happy with the phone but I was not happy with the old Android Version and laggy performance but I got used to it. Recently they sent me update for Android 9 and a security patch. After the update, I love the performance of my phone and Samsung has really optimized the software. I use Nova Lancher which works very well my phone. I have seen significant improvement in RAM consumption as well. I bought this phone and had to travel to USA for my work and to my surprise, it works with the AT&T SIM here which is not pssible with vendors like Xiomi. It saved me from buying a new phone in USA. Thanks to Samsung. The SAR rating is very low and the battery backup is amazing.

Go ahead and buy the phone. Trust the global brand like Samsung.

422,Ajmal,Decent option in its segment but could've been better especially in camera quality,"Fingerprint reader is not that fast didn't used face recognition was never interested in it so not gonna talk about it. Battery is awesome lasted for around 2 days with above average use. Camera is not that good i expected a much better experience especially when competitors like redmi note 7 pro provides a real good camera. Selfi cam is more pathetic i don't know if it can be improved by a software updation if it's, then i would like to have it soon very disappointed with selfie cam.
Don't want to talk about gameing experience because i don't play games that much.
Mobile looks good it gives a premium feel oh i forgot about Amoled experience it's really nice display is unbeatable in its segment. Overall i think i'm just okay with the money i spend",13 June 2019,3
423,Ranju Hansda,Lies somewhere between better and best,"I've been using this for the past 3 months.

Camera- 3/5
Although it has triple camera but doesn't live upto the hype. Pro mode- waste. why because only controls iso and wb. I mean seriously, a phone within rs.6000 has that feature.
Doesnt have slow motion, no hyperlapse, low light- although the ad states but worthless.
The thing is it needs light. I've seen this personally, when clicking in daylight it gives awesome pictures.

Performance-4/5
It has 1.6×2 cores and 1.8×6 cores. So on average octa core at 1.8 ghz.

Battery- 5/5.
This is one of its plus point. On average use it lasted for 2 days easily with 8 percent left.

Screen-5/5. Bro its 6.4 inch sAMOLED.
Additional- dedicated sim and SD slot. No ads. I read some review where they mentioned about ad. I don't think they know what they're talking about.
Lowest radiation than other brand phones.
Has Type C so its fast in data transfer too.
There was one stand out feature. Idk whether other phones have it or not but it seems that we can control the brightness of flashlight

In other features the phone is good,
excellent camera, super display, smooth working.

426,Omkar Ghike,"Underrated Powerpacked phone, Value for money.","To start with, fingerprint sensor is good, a bit unreachable initially..but you'll get adapted to that....
Camera quality is also good.....could've been more better.....front cam works like magic.....low light photography is better in front cam than rear.....live focus is satisfactory.....no slowMo...wide angle is nice.....
For battery life....you shouldnt face any issues with the heavily powered 5000mAh battery.....with a moderately heavy use you can expect your phone to last a whole day or a bit more than that.....fast charging actually works....
Talking of performance, your phone will feel a bit laggy. But as soon a you update your phone to Pie, it totally changes itself. Andriod PIE update is available and you can update as soon as you purchase the phone. If you are using an old phone and if you buy this one, you'll feel like, ""what sorcery is this???how can a phone perform all these things???was i living in stoneAge or something???""
Discussing about other features, Display is awesome, speaker quality is nice..works beautifully with Dolby Atmos which you can use with external speakers and earphones.Rear Cover looks catchy and shiny but better keep it guarded with a screen guard or something as it is very prone to sticky fingerprints and scratches.

2. Camera : Its camera might not be the best in it's segment but it is really good except for that it lacks in Image stabilization and low light pics are really grainy.
3.Battery : 5000 mAh battery lives upto it's size and is really very good. 5 stars for battery. Even after 24 hours of moderate to heavy use, i got 25% battery left.
4. Fast charger is really very quick.
5. Always on Display is a great feature.
6. Dolby atmos surround sound when using Headset or when connected to Bluetooth

CONS:
1. Camera: though it is good, it could have been really better.
2. The back of the phone gets very easily scratched so A back cover becomes a compulsion.
3. Could have provided good earphones with the phone.",18 June 2019,5

438,Praveen kumar,Screen broken due to heat up,"While talking on a call, phone heat up and I heard a click noise, I checked phone and found screen touch cracked. Samsung service center and Indian service head did not accept fault. Technical issues can happen in electronic items but service is worst in Samsung. Or I can say no after sale service is there. Samsung did not accepted fault in my wobble fully auto washing machine in which we faced severe deadly electric shock but they did not accept fault. At least outside technician resolved my issue. In conclusion, service is not there once you purchase product. Its your luck if product works without fault but if any fault occurs, do not expect service",6 June 2019,1
439,Abhideep,Samsung M30 - a sleek monster,"Samsung M30 is an excellent value for money. At the price range, it offers competent configurations. I have been using it for over a month and here are my reviews:

Over all performance: Satisfactory. Though I bought the 6GB variant, there is no comparable improvement in performance when compared to a 3 GB variant. That being said, I have not observed significant delay in boot time of apps and concurrent background apps continue from the last session rather than re-launching.

Camera: I am slightly unhappy with the 13MP primary camera. With the other configurations being competitive, a 13 MP primary camera seems amateurish. The picture quality retains the standard and with ambient light, pictures are of good quality. The 16 MP front camera is impressive and captures good selfie images. The other features of wide angle lens of primary camera, subject focus of both front and rear camera are also impressive and lives up to the expectation.

Battery: The 5000 mAh battery is quite a mammoth. Do not expect it to last 2 days though. The idea is that with a good screen use throughout the day, there will still be some juice left in the battery to last the night. This seems reasonable battery backup before charging it up again.

Media: The display and video effects are quite good. The DolbyAtmos needs a special mention which gives a notch to the audio experience when an ear phone is plugged in.

OS: I received Oxygen in the boxed set and was a big disappointed. But Samsung released Pie with One UI within a month and this elated my mood.

Overall its a very good smart phone to use at this price point. It would have been a nice though to include a silicone back cover and a screen guard in the box.

If brand is of importance to you, then Samsung M30 will be worthy choice for you to consider.",18 June 2019,4
440,vivek Kumar,Price worthy,"First of all I would like to inform you that I am writing this review after 2month of purchase of m30 black 4gb ram. This is the best in in mid range of 15k. Phone has got its update i.e. android 9 which is awesome. Phone has super battery performance.once fully charged phone can run up to 2 days in normal usage. Phone is awesome for gaming user but I will recommend them to got with 6gb ram variants. Talking with phone design the front panel is looking sexy,and as well as back.one issue with back panel is that it is very slippery you need to handle it properly if you didn't have back cover.coming with camera quality front 16 megapixel is awesome I can't imagine the picture quality in this range of phone only issue with front camera is low light issues.secondly if we talk about primary camera it's too good.triple camera with wide angle is awesome.even low light is not a big deal.i have posted some pictures for camera quality. Talking about fingerprints it is placed little above so in starting you will face some issues while using it but at later stage it will be okay for you. For charging they had provided type c charger which is very much cool. Full phone will get charged within less than 2hrs reason as battery is 5000 mah so it is taking some time but if you charging for 30 mins also it's enough for 5 to 6 hrs. Only think which I am disappointed is that they didn't provide earphone Talking about overall performance phone is awesome I had used it for 2months and personally I am very much satisfied with phone performance Samsung had done wonderful job in mid segment price range. I would also thank Amazon India which delivers the product within 1 day. If you desire any phone under 15k m30 is best which I will recommend.",19 June 2019,5
441,RAJESH KRISHAN,Not Up to Mark,"Touch is slow and to disconnect the call u have to touch red button again n again. While scrolling up/down when u touch the screen to stop scrolling it takes a while to stop. The camera is also not up to mark. I was fan of Samsung phones but after using MI Note 5 Pro it lags behind in software and performance and if we compare M30 with MI Note7 Pro then Samsung will be far far behind.
Waiting for software update, maybe Samsung fixes all issues in update.",6 April 2019,3
442,Aditya,An overrated underperforming phone.,"It's been 2 weeks since I'm using the m30 4/64 phone. While on the outside the phone looks stunning and the display is ever glowing eye catching the phone is nothing but disappointing when it comes to performance. The face recognition is slow and below average at best but the fi gerprint sensor makes up for it. Due to the notch display and the huge screen you will end up touching the phone where you never meant to. The camera is decent with comparison to current standards.
The processor is its biggest weakness. The phone is noticeably slow for medium yo heavy users. While the Ram is 4gb it doesn't reflect on the performance. Games like PUBG hang and move very slow with an infuriating lag. I stopped playing pubg since I got this phone. The battery capacity is huge. 5000mah. It will easily last you a day (18) hours but on the flip side it takes that much longer get for it to charge.
The software is unreliable. The phone stopped taking network by the end of first week in use. I have already been to the service center twice.The screen sometimes goes blank when you're watching a video and turn the phone horizontally. The lock button is way too sensitive so you will end up accidentally locking and unlocking often. As far as image stabilization after zoom is concerned,iPhone 6 beats it even today and I'm saying this out of experience not on a speculative whim.
In conclusion,while the phone is cheap for its specifications it does not match up to Samsung's brand name. There are much better phones out there with better performance at possibly a cheaper rate.",18 April 2019,1
443,NEERAJ JAIN,good but not that good,"writing this review after using it for sometime.
i wanted to go for a50 actually but this m30 was suggested me by a friend with such a hype that i had to buy it. trust me you should NOT buy it as it actually doesnt meets the mark or hype.

1. processor is not upto the amrk. tried playing pubg and it lags as hell.
2. battery was projected like it is 5000mah but upon use u will know that it doesnt stands for more than one day of normal use with wifi.
3. display is good you will be happy ONLY if you havent seen a50.
4. the layout of the phone's back is very very normal its nothing like a50 or any similar samsung phone.
5. you get 128gb of storage but thats of no use if you cant play games properly without lag.
6. out of 6gb ram you get lesser than needed for lag-less functioning.

if you do want to go then go for a50 rather than this one.",9 April 2019,3
444,Mr.Dakshaykumar V Jakhia,Faulty instruments and upgrade of software.,"I have purchased M30 Samsung online on Amazon on 15 may 2019. After automatic upgrade of software it just died on 12 june 2019 , within 27 days of purchase. When approaching Samsung customer service at Andheri west on 25th june 2019 they have advised that the mobile phone can be replaced with new only within 14 days and now mother board Will be replaced.
Why Samsung can not replace with new phone? As i was touring abroad all my picture and videos are lost due to this faulty piece or update. It has created tremendous amount of anxiety to me and family.
Atleast they should compensate for the loss of data and inconvenience caused to me when I was abroad.
Hope this Will reach to the responsible office. I.e Amazon and Samsung.

best camera, you should definitely get Samsung M30. It has pretty good standby. The screen on time
has also been way beyond my expectations. It has 5000 mAh battery with a C type adapter in the box

worthy investment. It takes around 40-45 mins to charge from 0-100%. Now, coming to the camera,

Crystal clear resolution. Really Fast face unlock and finger print sensor. It is light in weight too. Phone's
touch is super smooth. It comes with a 4GB Ram and 64GB internal memory which is expandable up to
512 GB. Also, phone has octa core processor with android Oreo version 8.1 This has by far been the

Battery- trust me, i was skeptical about the 5k mah until i used it on day one. I am a Very heavy user (100-200 calls/day, Watsapp,office email,fb, Instagram etc till i go to bed) and 100% charge at 9am in mng reaches only 40% after 12-14 hr of usage.

Camera-auto focus, front cam, depth etc. Works good. However, i found some pixelation at zoom. Not sure if m using it incorrectly or its a Device issue.

Display- phenomenal, amazing Samsung is class apart from similar range competitive products. Supeb clarity and u notch makes it look premium.

Gaming- ASPHALT 9 is working smooth. I didn't load many games but benchmark is asphalt so u can decide.

Heating problem- not at charging, 30+ minute on ASPHALT makes u feel the warmth. Not bothering though.

Processor- toggling between screens is smooth, machine response is great.

sadly, no NFC.

1. Display quite smooth and pleasing.
2. Don't think about polycarbonate body, build is good.
3. Batery backup as compare to 5k is ok.
Corns:
1. Don't get puzzled by youtube review, camera is just ok as it include AI, pixel is not clear but for social media it will do the job.
2. Design i think samsung followed the trend and other brand. My first notch display phone, thought it's gonna be ok, but trust me it looks really odd.
3. Speaker sound quality not good, not a bit loud, just a cheap sound like low budget phone.
4. Main thing where it comes to PUBG? You wont enjoy the gaming with the frame drop in balanced mode with medium frame rate. Lag is effective , lol the design is poor they have kept the speakar gaap in the bottom side so u will face interruption while gaming, the grip won't go easy as it have headphone jack also in the bottom- left. Which will definitely make u feel odd while gaming in loudspeaker or headphone. Even after 7days of use it has started to lag in basic/normal graphics with medium fram rate.

Rear camera is good if you do not use the wide angle.. Wide angle camera captures more thing but not so clearly.
Front camera captures best selfies.
2. Screen
Screen is excellent with adaptive brightness. And infinity U display looks sexy ans well as stunning.

It lasts in 2 day. If you continuously use it over data browsing.
Its charging completes in aprrox 1 hour and 30 minutes with the fast type C charger.
4. Fingerprint scanner
To unlock your phone fingerprint scanner is bit slow.

The phone supposed to work best for 5000 mah battery by giving more than a day with single charge but this phone doesn't go more than a day max.(Max 12 or 14 hours) . I believe this phone still not optimized for battery usage when you have Bluetooth and mobile data always on.. though you use very less usage, the battery drain very fast.. Rest of all, it is good phone compare to Redmi note 7 pro.. The big problem is, samsung is not a kind of company who give updates frequently.. so you have to live with this kind of phone for entire life.

Its been 2 months and I am still on this phone as its features and qualities makes me love it. Its 4GB Ram and its Exynos 7904 processor make Gaming experience so good I play both Mobile Legends and PUBG and the gaming is still great no lags, no interruptions very smooth, it's a great phone for gamers as it has got great battery life and it also changes real quick. The figureprint sensor are of great quality and it's very smooth and quick, it comes with another option to unlock the phone that is face identification which makes it easy for users to unlock their phone but the Face ID does not work at night. The camera of the phone are amazing the triple camera makes every pic so beautiful it's great for videography the videos that I took are quite steady and the front camera really enhances your every pic , it also come with many camera features with is really fun like the stickers and the live focus feature. The battery life is amazing it takes least time to charge and has a long battery life I usually charge my phone once or twice a day, I am a gamer and the battery life really impressed me. The perfect phone with a low price , all the features that I need and I had it delivered in just one week thanks to Amazon.

472,Anas Shamsi,Galaxy m30 review after 3 months using as primary device (100% Honest and self experienced),"I purchased the m30 gradation black in mid march and its been more than 3 months for me now using this phone as my primary device.
Its a very good phone at this price.
My 1st priority while buying a phone was the screen quality and m30 was the best at this price with a super amoled fhd+ display.
The fingerprint reader can be improved a little bit and can make it a little faster while unlocking, though while setting up the fingerprint its super fast I have never seen so fast fingerprint setup in any other phones.
Camera quality can also be improved more. I hope Samsung could provide any kind of image stabiliser support in software in future updates. I liked the front camera(16mp) it takes awesome pics even in dark. U won't be even needing the front screen flash while taking pics from front camera.
I also wish for having camera to api support as I can use Google camera then.

When for software I have received the one ui update with android pie and it has improved a lot in the overall performance of the phone.
I hate that Samsung has not provided any bixby home or any kind of bixby in the m30.
Many other apps like goodlock also is not available for us m30 users. I hope Samsung fix this and provide us the bixby home, bixby voice, etc and such other more awesome features which us m30 users still can't experience even after getting the one ui update.

Overall I am happy with using the galaxy m30. Just little more improvements from Samsung which I stated above can make this phone the best for the youth as myself.",18 June 2019,4
473,uttamkumar b.,samsung m30 has a problem,"This phone has a very big problem . If the phone is allowed to drain off its battery completely , it does not charge up again , even if you keep it on charge for 12 hours. Samsung needs to fix this . This means that the phone must never be allowed to go close to zero charge . when it is about 10 to 20 % charge , you must connect it to a charger . IF you leave it the way it is , it will never charge up again . I have faced this problem . I was expecting better product from Samsung, especially at that price. Please feel free to contact me on 9920725963 should someone wish to discuss this any further. Ideally , i should receive a replacement handset or a discount on what i have paid.",29 June 2019,1
474,Jessin Joseph,Really nice product from Samsung.,"I have been using this product since 1 month.

Recently recieved update for android pie.

1. Battery
I really love its battery . It lasts long and is convenient for long journeys. It supports fast charging as well as there is a fast charger in box . Others don't provide fast charger.

2.Screen
It is awesome and good for eyes health. But incase you break it, replacement will be costly.

3.Sound
Dolby atoms and other sound adjustments makes it really awesome to play music through earphones.

I don't use the speaker much. I felt it is good and enough sound is there.

4.Camera
Awesome cameras on both sides. Good clarity. But needs good light for perfect shots.
Wide angle camera is practically useful but the clarity of the picture is really low.
Live focus is really good.

5. Fingerprint
It's good but not as fast as other phones. That doesn't mean it is slow or unresponsive. Its bit slow that's it.

6. Face identification.
I don't use this feature so I can't comment on it.

7. Heating
Comparing to other phones, this phone does not heat much. While charging or continous usage, it heats up little but that's just a usual thing.

Processor speed
I felt no lags till now. It is smooth and is performing well.

And finally , it's SAMSUNG. Also the after sales services and customer support are really good.",18 June 2019,5
475,VAMSI P,Samsung is brand whereas Chinese are---------?Boss is back in MIDRANGE!,"Hi,after searching a lot for mid range mobile I came to know about M30 and I researched a lot and found this is best.Today I received this mobile within 24hrs of order
For me 64GB ROM is enough as I have lap,and coming to mobile it is very fast,screen is ultimate,and video player automatically fits the videos into full display,i charged the mobile up to 91% and I used for 6hrs(videos,browsing,calls) and after 6hrs it fallen to 72% I haven't expected this sort of battery before.
Phone is very smooth I felt like I am using S9 the only difference is back,,it is premium plastic that's it but it is very good if you go with back cover.
Before I used coolpad and also vivo but believe me Samsung is best.... don't go with Chinese ,,,,in my opinion if you are looking for a wonderful phone in 15K just blindly place the order I am that much confident about that.
Don't research more,just buy this in single line it is better than all Chinese brands...they will be today and go away t'mrw ..when I bought coolpad in 2k16 coolpad was everywhere,what about now????people don't even know that coolpad was there...so please go with Samsung....if you don't have PC or laptop I would recommend you to go with 128GB ROM else this is enough..I got 49.8Gb user space out of 64 Gb.
Just buy this if you want value for money....!
Thanks for your patience and don't forget to buy this,bye!",1 May 2019,5

2. Front camera
Front camera performs gud, and it takes pretty much selfies which has stunning clarity

3. Exynos 7904
This mobile comes with exynos 7904 processor which is best in multi tasking but its really waste in heavy gaming.. it runs pubg smoothly in balanced graphics without any single lack..",18 June 2019,4

Just saying. Won't be using Samsung.,22 May 2019,1
478,thonts,Magnificent M30,"Samsung Galaxy M30 is a best device in the segment. I've been using this phone for more than a couple of months and it is doing great. What I really find incredible is it's SAR value, which is lowest among many devices. The finger print reader is impulsive which unlock the device within fraction of a second. The selfie camera is AI embedded which will detect the faces and do beautification of the image. The rear triple camera set is more than enough to capture spectacular images in different light conditions. The camera also provides wide angle capture option which is incredibly good. But it lacks slow motion capture. In summary the camera quality is sufficient enough and will get you some extraordinary pictures as sweet memories.
The processor is speed enough to work with multiple apps and windows simultaneously without any glitches. The 4GB RAM is large enough for my working capacity.
One important thing I really appreciate with this device is it's Spectacular SMOLED display and the smooth touch response. The display is competitive with any other higher segment phones.
The battery life better for day to day operation. The 5000mAh battery is long lasting for more than 24 hours is usage.
I arguably recommend this device over any other model in this price segment and one can buy this without a second thought.",18 June 2019,5

Samsung's Galaxy M30 gets right into the mix with what it packs.Coming from the Galaxy M10 and M20, the Galaxy M30 slots right above the Galaxy M20 and packs in a gorgeous Super AMOLED display instead of LCD, a mammoth 5,000 mAh battery and triple rear cameras that certainly pack a punch and its fingerprint sensor works so quickly and also its face unlock is as fast as fingerprint sensor it iscertainly a great phone.

483,Mukteswar Patnaik,Wastage of Money,"It's alluring to see a triple camera, 5000mah, beautiful looking samsung device at this price but trust me , for battery go for Motorola OnePower , for camera have your choice but I will never recommend it.

What's wrong?

1. Though 6gb , usability it is neither smooth not even close to fast
2. Camera is not extra ordinary, even a decent dual-cam give you the same
3. Battery... Even my old Lenovo K8 Note is way better than M30
4. Most critical: frequently shows network issues or sim doesn't support. While Roaming with in the india it goes out of reach and so many times I have to restart or manually search .
5. Anyways it's India specific mobile so may hv network issues.
6. Got Android 9 update too but tons of issues as sometimes call log doesn't work & oftenly contacts hangs or doesn't show. Soln: restart everytime

Conclusion: It's simply a waste of money as at way lower to this cost also way better handsets are available with descent performance & quality.

Still wondering whether amazon/samsung can help in anyways???",10 May 2019,1

Finger print sensitivity is good.
Display looks awesome.
Performance is good.
Battery capacity and charging speed is good.
MOBILE LOOKS AWESOME IN OUR HANDS...!!

Only con that I face with Samsung (Not particularly for this mobile, for all the Samsung mobiles) is that I feel your UI is not that much attractive as like that of the android's default one. Also I love dark mode. But I don't have option for that in Samsung.",26 May 2019,5

491,Ajay A,Features are removed with every update.,"Features are being removed/reduced with every update the phone gets.
Example,
1. The split screen was accessible by long pressing the app switch button and it did not stop the on-going application. Now it has been moved to the app icon on the switch view. This stops the on-going app and then switch on the app to start again.
2. The adaptive brightness used to work fine, after the update it takes time to sense the background light and adjust brightness.
3. Dolby Atoms had a noticeable difference before the update, now I can hardly make out any difference in the sound quality.

There are few more minus points I have noticed. Received 2 updates so far. Hoping these issues are rectified with the next update.

From big 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display to gradation blue look, curved sides of the phone to rounded corners, giant super 5000mAh battery which last longer than you can imagine plus 15W charger help you stay away from the charger a lot longer than usual. Oh! did I forgot to mention about triple camera set up at the back and having a Samsung camera app which is very simple and easy to use. For selfie it has a small notch in the centre of the top, which houses the selfie camera.

Very handy for day to day activities, performance to handle multitasking is really good. Notification setting for apps lets you not annoy any app unnecessarily. Initially it came up with Android 8.1 Oreo now upgraded to Android 9. Tweaking of display at your pleasure gave you a kinda comfort, very few preinstalled apps.

This smartphone of Samsung has everything and that too at a very reasonable price. Last but not least, among my favorite handy gestures of this phone is its fingerprint scanner which let you pull the notification shade down, swipe up to close it and chats over video.",18 June 2019,5

No lags noticed on day to day use inspite of its very weak processor(I'm not a gamer though)

Has Headphone Jack.

Cons -
Not a very good value for money

Bad choice for gamers.

The chin of this phone is bigger than it is shown on the images.

Camera is not good

Fingerprint scanner is quite slow and often does not work.

Face unlock is very bad

No sterio speakers

Experience UI sucks but one UI update made it a little better.

Overall -
If you want better performance, price, fingerprint scanner, camera, aesthetics, you'll be better off with redmi, poco, realme

Display - Probably one of the highlights of the phone. Super AMOLED display on a budget smartphone! Best in class.
Battery Life - The day passes like a breeze and by the end of it, I'm still left with a good 20% with moderate-heavy usage.
Camera - I'm not a photographer, but know a good click when I see one. Pictures on the M30 come out with great clarity and depth. My favorite feature in the camera, ""Live Focus""!
Processor - Not the best out there, but can easily handle games like PUBG with no lag. I'm a moderate user and it's more than sufficient for my day to day needs.
Design - Yes it has a plastic body (they need to save costs somewhere), but the phone feels sleek and elegant in hand.
PS: I still don't understand how they managed to squeeze a 5k mAh battery into such a slim body!

The gradation blue colour on the back which fades from light to dark looks very attractive.
Great viewing experience with 6.4"" FHD + Super Amoled Infinity U notch display.
It gets a triple rear camera setup : 13 megapixel primary sensor, 5 megapixel ultra wide angle lens and a 5 megapixel depth sensor for live focus.
Ultra wide angle works great and live focus also works very well (as seen in pictures) but sometimes edges are not that sharp in live focus mode.
On the front it has a 16 megapixel single selfie camera with screen flash and an aperture of f/2.0. Front camera also offers live focus which works very good.
5000 mAh battery offers a pretty good battery life and also charge up very fast with in-box 15W USB type-C fast charger.
What I liked the most about this phone is its Fingerprint reader and Face Unlock feature, both are ultra responsive.

The ultra wide camera is perfect but same cannot be said for the live focus one. In all a phone for gamers or movie sleuths but not recommended for its camera.

510,RITESH UMAP,Honest review from your brother,"After one month of heavy usage.
Pros-
1. Super amoled display. (this is the reason i bought it)
2. 5000mAh battery, it really lasts long.
3. Camera quality is really good, rear camera works really well and selife cam is just awesome. (Just turn off the beauty mode)
4. Fingerprint sensor is decent, not that fast but i guess OTA update can make it fast.
5. Earphone output is really good plus the Dolby Atmos feature just makes the experience great. (EDM lover soo you can trust this)
6. Always on display is a cool feature to use.
7. Blue light filter works well.
Cons-
1. Processor is used is not from snapdragon but that's not an issue for me as exynos works well while heavy gaming also.
2. Please say at this price point you can get many features in readmi and realme phones but they have annoying ads to and realme color OS just sucks and no amoled display.
For me Samsung works best in class.
If you're planning to buy just go for it.
""NO Ads""",18 June 2019,4
511,Donny Da,Good Competitor for Redmi Phones," This phone works really really good and in this price bracket their is an rival which is xiaomi redmi Note 7 pro, which is more technically advanced phone but if you want to use your phone as a daily driver and you'll not do heavy gaming and all that you will definitely be happy with this phone and if you want to use your heavy user and have to use multitasking gaming music videos and all that like hardcore Gamers like that kind of persons with their souls into their phones so if the area that can the person you need to use redmi Note 7 Pro otherwise this is far better from to redmi Note 7 pro because of this had amoled screen which is a huge difference in terms of display quality as well as the battery life is also good in this phone.

516,Uttkarsh Dutt,"After 3 months of usage, I can confidently say","This is quite honestly the most efficient smart phone in this price range for everyday use. Mid range smart phones these days offer a lot of features for their price point and focus a lot on camera specs but this phone does something different and is truly a game changer in Samsung's mid range department. For ppl wanting a daily driver that they can just charge once and forget about for the rest of the day, or maybe two days, this phone truly delivers on that aspect with a 5000mah mega battery life.
Want to watch a movie on Netflix but taking out the laptop is too much work? This phone comes with an infinite super AMOLED display that gives you amazing range of Colors and true black on the screen so it's almost better than watching on average display laptops.
The speakers work great.
Android 9 update was recently pushed.
With 6GBs of RAM and 128GB of storage, there's not much to worry about in terms of multitasking and application downloads.",18 June 2019,5
517,Jagadish patra,Lot of promises but disappointing approach by Samsung,"Coming from a brand like Samsung, with so much promise in terms of feature and camera, thought this would be a game changer for Samsung. But the degradation in quality is very disappointing. Just for the shake of ticking all the boxes Samsung has gone into the wrong path by compromising the rmquality part.
Pros:
1. Display with adaptive brightness
2. Camera
3. Processing speed improved after recent updat
4. Exterior look and build

Cons:
1. Fingerprint sensor
2. Constantly I am receiving notifications on moisture cut up in my type c charging slot. It's frustrating since I can't charge my phone and that notification keep harassing me by not letting me charge my phone for 10-12 hrs
3. 6 GB RAM and the phone works like 4GB RAM
4. 5000 mah battery is just a bluff. It hardly lasts one day
5. Connectivity issues

Verdict: Still the winner in this price segment as non of them focuses on quality",18 June 2019,3
518,Lima Kichu,Great phone from Samsung.,"Been using it for a week now and i admit its a good phone for daily usage...
1. The best thing about the Galaxy M30 is its battery.. On moderate use, i.e. internet browsing, playing music, watching videos, talktime etc. a fully charged phone lasts 2-3days..
2. The single speaker at the bottom was better than expected with a hint of bass.
3. Screen is vibrant and good display of colors.
4. Major let down was the camera. Was expecting a lot for its triple camera functionality but the picture quality was below average specially at auto mode..

Features that i found the best were:
1. It's battery is just wow, it can go on and on. It can last for more than 7 hrs, when you are continuously playing games or doing online streaming.
For moderate users I'm sure it can last for more than 20 hrs.
2. Its camera is good, front camera is amazing for selfies even in little dim light and back camera is surperb too.
3 touch is awesome, feels slick and smooth, but can get scratched easily, if not protected by Protector screen.
4 fingerprint reader works smoothly, no hassles.

528,Priyanshu,Master Blaster,"There are hundreds of benefits to buy Samsung Galaxy M30 But I'll be talking here about it's major pros. The M30 receives an upgrade in the form of a Super AMOLED panel measuring 6.4-inches. It has a Full HD+ (2280 x 1080 pixels) resolution and sports the infinity-U notch design. This makes for a 19.5:9 aspect ratio of the screen. This looks so rich and comfortable at the same time. The overall phone look is way more premium considering it's price.
Let's talk about it's camera now, the three camera setup on the M30 consists of a primary 13MP sensor with an f/1.9 aperture coupled with a 5MP depth-sensor and a 5MP ultra-wide angle sensor that enables a 123-degree field of view. Isn't it a small DSLR? Photography enthusiasts can play around with the wide-angle camera for some landscape imagery that stands out. Also, M30 has a 16MP camera in front so that you do not have to compromise your beauty because of bad front camera.
Also it is powered by Exynos 7904 chipset. It’s an octa-core CPU utilizing two Cortex-A73 clusters clocked at 1.8GHz for power-hungry tasks and six Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.6GHz for power-efficiency.
This is paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage.
Samsung has outfitted the Galaxy M30 with a 5,000mAh battery which also supports fast charging via the 15w(3x) adapter provided in-the-box.
Samsung Galaxy M30 is loaded with so many other exciting features but in two words my new phone is a Master blaster.",13 March 2019,5
529,Sandipan,Classy looking budget phone,"I have been using this for 3 days now. So far so good. The design and look of the phone is very classy. Might turn a few heads while you are outside. The camera decent to good depending on the light conditions. The display is amazing-great for movies and games. The phone itself is very smooth. With the Android 9 update, it's loaded with features. The headphone quality is also awesome with Doldby atmos. No problem with multitasking as well.
The only thing I bothering me is the touch. I haven't got a temper glass yet. The thing is sometimes the touch is sometimes unresponsive with light touches even though the touched part might glow up on contact but the function may not occur. You have to try again with a firmer touch. I am don't why it's happening. But there is a feature of increasing sensitivity with tamper glass on. Hope it gets better after turning it on.
All in all a great phone...4.25/5.",1 June 2019,4

The camera quality was up to good and it has a nice wide angle effect. It also had a good focus without using live focus option feature. I had high hopes for the battery which was successfully implemented and I love it. Fingerprint reader is up to mark and fast. Compareing it live to the s10+ was actually not a bad choice. Speaking of which, the 15w charger was a huge hit from my side because of its current battery life. One point to be noted was the inbox items has be upgraded as it requires an headset and case if possible.

Portrait mode is also good. Super crystal clear selfies at outdoors. Battery life is good. SuperAmoled display makes viewing experience superb. Supports 5GHz WiFi transmission whereas M30 doesn'twhich is not mentioned in specifications. Faster processor no lag in opening any window.
Lowest SAR value means lower radiation emission hence more safe.
Cons
Rear cover looks classy much better than that shown in the photo but its plastic body hence catches scratches easily.
Not received Android pie & Samsung one UI update whereas lower J series started receiving it however Samsung said they will update soon.
Poor wide angle shots quality.",7 May 2019,5

The tall aspect ratio of the phone makes it feel very comfortable in the hand. The phones gets the juice from its Exynos octa-core processor which is paired with 4 GB of RAM.

I enjoys watching movies, match, t.v., listening songs, playing games, clicking & posting photos, reading news, books or article on it.

It allows me to install a number of softwares easily, keep my data safe. Easy to use & handel.
Battery is excellent. Continue use, remain till 30 to 32 hrs. Most important safe battery.

550,Mukesh S,Worth it considering all aspects,"I bought 6gb/128gb variant..worth every rupee ..camera quality is very good,battery after heavy usage stands for 2 days.fingerprint reader is fast compared to other phones..I didn't find any lags as I don't play games which cause other phones to heat but without any hitch..fast charging is available with 15w charger..amoled display best in class..Samsung released android pie and Samsung one ui update in just after a month of buying..
Recently faced a problem water entered into phone and phone gave notification warning as 'moisture detected' & refused to charge ..I waited for 2 days still was unable to charge as it kept showing the warning..so I went to nearby Samsung service center they resolved the issue within a hour under free warranty which comes with the phone..as always Samsung has good service compared to other brands..that's a huge plus",18 June 2019,5

552,Vinayak,Pros and cons,"If you are looking for a change of brand from Mi to Samsung it is a decent purchase
I had previously used the Mi note 4 and it was a beast of a phone that I had used for 3 years.
This phone has an amazing battery backup it might be the case since it is new later stages might change the result
The build and finish feels pretty good
The best part is the screen the amoled display
If you are one of those who do not use your smartphone for gaming it is a good buy
And for those who are in mobile gaming but the note 7 pro
There are pretty frequent frame drops while playing pubg just for the sake of testing I downloaded pubg
For those who use there phones for binging the voice quality and the display won't let you down
The battery back ups amazing too last for more than a day supporting the display
Finally the phone has a good feel to it.
Review might change overtime",30 May 2019,4
553,Amazon Customer,True to its specifications and even better...!!!,"This is the phone of my dreams at this price....way better than Redmi Note 7 Pro....in every manner even in performance if you had any doubts!!! I have the 6/128 GB variant and this launch, pop up and switch in less than the blink of an eye...! Battery backup is Ultimate...! 5 minute charge gaya it from 90 to 100% charge..!
6.4 inch Super AmoLED FHD+ Display is gorgeous to look at!
Camera is way too good at this price point and has a lot of features including Live Focus...!
It has Dual SIM + Dedicated Memory Card and Dolby Atoms Sound while using good quality Headphones
Overall...! It's way better than Red mi Note 7 Pro in every department...!!!",13 April 2019,5
554,Amazon Customer,The best viewing experience under 20k.,"The best viewing experience under 20k. I know a lot of flak that this phone draws is because of its inferior processor. Yes it's not a Snapdragon processor, yes it's gaming performance is not great(if you consider high specs game like pubg or asphalt, also if you aren't prejudiced, you won't find it as bad as it is being conveyed), but the point is, should it be the deciding factor for you? Again, it depends on you. One of the big chunk of information that people withhold is that normal to medium-high games hold well. Camera is again, don't expect a DSLR under 20k. Daylight photography won't disappoint. But the display, full hd+ super amoled viewing experience takes the cake. For me, being a casual, lazy gamer at best, this phone with it's best in class display makes sense. Also, I got it for around Rs 15500 with my Moto g4 plus for exchange.",2 June 2019,4

558,IVAN REYNOLDS,One of the best mobile at this price,"Worst decision I made since last few years... I am user of honor 5x,6x,7x... Since 8x was old and i trusted Samsung, bought this mobile and highly disappointed. Very poor camera(triple camera cannot do anything) and display lag for this price. Worst is the UI.. bought Asus Zenfone m2 for 8k for my mom.. which I feel a better mobile comparatively

Update as on 29th June .. rating to 5 star from 1 star..I take back my my previous negative comment.. after updating to pie and using it for almost 2 weeks now.. the UI is smooth, games performance is good ,actually very good. Still camera performance is not that much good in low light. But day light it gives you a better shot ... hope a future update brings improvement in camera department... no display can match upto this price.. although 5000 may battery.. for me with heavy usage. Videos,games,browsing.. it does not come even a day.. may be due to display... but I feel bad for previous rating for this wonderful device",11 May 2019,5
559,Akshay Gamare,Not up to the mark .. expected high from Samsung,"1.Camera is not upto the mark ... MI 7PRO has much better camera than Samsung m30.
2.5000mah battery really performs well.
3.Screen is amoled so colour contrast, resolution and picture quality is very good.
4.Was expected stock android unfortunately Samsung has not provided stock android.
5.fingure print scanner is not good as MI .... MI has much better fingure print scanner.
6.Very strong feedback to Samsung (is it due to cost cutting?) Samsung u provides earphone in 1.5k-2k mobiles but not in this high end I mean why ?
7.In this price range was expecting snapdragon unfortunately it's not snapdragon its exynos.
8.overall 18-19k is the price of this mobile and out of 5 I will give 3 stars.
In this price range MI OPPO VIVO and ASUS offers u better deals in this price range.",2 July 2019,3

I personally never liked samsung earlier but this product samsung m30 changed my perception totally. Beginning from the fingerprint sensor, camera, touch, amoled display, battery life, everything is just point to perfection. Only the thing samsung can improve is the material of the case, but its not that big an issue. Overall I am happy with this product and I would definitely suggest people buying it as it is worth the price. Getting perfect configurations at this price is worth a try. Thanks samsung. Last but not the least amazon can improve the packing of such expensive products. This is the only thing I was not satisfied with.

569,J Mallick,Value for Money,"This is the best you can get in this price range.
-> The main highlight of this phone is the screen. It's super brite, sharp and the touch works super smooth.
-> Its 4GB RAM makes it superfast and all the apps load in a flash. I haven't played any game on it, but some of my friends who use the same phone experience minimum or no lag while playing PUBG mobile or Asphalt 9.
-> With decent use and keeping internet on all day, its 5000 mAh battery lasts entire day. With continuous media watching on weekends it lasts over 10-11 hours.
-> 13MP main camera + 5MP live focus lens + 5MP wide angle camera on the back helps in clicking amazing pictures. And 16MP front camera clicks amazing selfies.

571,HARDIK MEVADA,THE BUDGET BEAST 💪🏻,"1)THE DISPLAY:- This phone is really amazing specs with his super amoled display and the display quality is as same as Samsung's flagship like Galaxy S9 and S9+.

2) SOFTWARE OPTIMIZATION:- Afer ONE UI update the software optimization is far better than the old software and it's feel more snapper.

3) BATTERY:- The Battery life of this phone is boy O boy it's a marathon winner phone in battery life. You can easily complete 2 days of heavy usage with this phone.

4) BUILT AND DESIGN:- The gradiant back Look more appealing than the normal plastic design. It has 5000 mAH battery but with this plastic design the phone is not so heavier. So the build and design is amazing.

thank you 😊.",21 June 2019,5
572,Ashish kawdey,Worst On M series by Samsung,I find product body lime defective production quality juat made this samsung m series worst i need to change this product as soon as possible but there is no gate way to return the item samsung store says the product is made in such a way only we cant do anything over all the phone is light weight bt if it gets droped once it might has d chance of getting backside broken first instead of front screen and some take too much time to unloack phone and some times under a sunny day it also dont detect and function slow in bright sunny light. Mostly get hanged and it take almost 2 min to reset worst product dont buy m series second thing for battery if used conditionally you charge it upto 50% den it usually drain quickly and if charged 100% it drain slowly as per time schedule,3 July 2019,2
573,Amazon Customer,You can loose your job if you use this phone,This is probably the worst phone in the market now. After a few days of use the phone stops charging. No it's not a battery issue. It's the very annoying 'moisture detected' issue. The phone had about 11% battery left. I plucked in the charger and 'moisture detected' message pops up. I was on a call with my client. after sometime the phone battery just died and didn't charge for 5 more hours. Faced a lot of heat from the client. Many others are also facing this issue.Never faced this kind of issue in any other phones. Had to buy a stand by phone. Looks Iike i lost my 15k on this phone.,8 June 2019,1
574,Anurag Ray,Worst Phone..Never buy it,"Its been 1.5 months since i bought it and its screen got damaged in 1.2 months..i have to go to Samsung servife centre to repair it. Alongwith that it has serious serious network issues. It gives 200-400 kbs download speed at most whereas when i put my sim in MI phones its gives 1.5-2 mbs speed which price is half of its price, so much difference.I did all the tricks to make it fast but it cant go beyond it. I bought this phone because of the hype and Samsung brand but this is the worst phone I ever had.I should have bought Redmi instead (never faced such issues in Mi phone. I have multiole Mi phones. This phone is waste of money. Looks like Samsung compromised quality for reducing the price. Expected better from Samsung. Never going to buy medium range Samsung phones.",23 May 2019,1
575,srinivasulu,Over all review about Samsung Galaxy m30,"Display:very good
Battery:very good
Signal reception: avg
UI: worst(apps taking more than 2 seconds to open and some times closing forcefully. )
Camera: front camera is good, but back camera not that much, it's avg.
Future OS Updates: Not mentioned any where in the box, how many years they will provide. Security updates also not mentioned.
Fingerprint Scanner: Avg(for me , it is failed atleast 5 times in a day, and taking more than second to open)
Face Unlock: worst (even close your eyes it will open,and it is also taking time to open)
Processor: Avg
Screen on display: 9hrs
Android 9 + One UI optimization: Avg
Finally I suggest if you want good display and good battery life ,you go with it. Don't expect more from One UI.",18 June 2019,3
576,Umashankar,Don't rush to buy.,No facility of smart view ( screen mirroring). Which means we can't see amazon prime videos in the tv by using chrome cast. Needs to be upgraded. Product seems to be under experimentation. Don't rush to buy.There was no review/comment by Samsung. No ear phones and back cover supplied as shown in the promo. Just a note of caution for fellow buyers.,15 May 2019,3
577,Melvin,A beast of a phone simply out done yourselves with this master piece. Stunning over all,Been using it for 2 days now and the battery gives awesome performance...no lag...no heating issues...camera is good and the apps run fluidly since i'm not much of a selfie or camera person i would still want everyone to know that this phone is simply WOW..buy without hesitation,12 April 2019,5
578,Anandu B.,I'm in love 🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰,"Super mobile, easy to use, camera quality is great The only problem I'm facing is the Data cable length. Type C cable is too short. And should have included a cover and headphone.
But overall I'm loving it. Battery life is great though camera quality is okay-okay and doesn't have 4K video recording no wide video recording but Fingerprint reader is fast.

Review after Pie update
..............................................
Everything is super fast
Camera quality is almost as double ( When I compare photo taken with oreo and pie)

Can run videos at 4k 60fps but it can't record it
One of the con's is that... And can't shoot slow motion

Pubg will run at medium settings and no heating issue and it's not lagging in any kind.

Sometimes it has some problem registering touch. Even without screenguard. But it's nothing I can't live without.
Speaking of which the screen... Absolute mind blowing 😍

My verdict Go for it! It's even better than M40.. has better battery and better screen size.",13 March 2019,5
579,Hrithik,Best buy. Great experience with this phone.,"Really happy with this phone. The camera quality is very good, triple lens for wide angle shot serves good purpose. Having 4gb ram enables very good gaming experience considering the brilliant display too. For me battery life is something very tempting about this phone, a huge 5000maH provides me 2 day continuous usage, fast charge helps too. The phone is very sleek and light. Audio quality is pretty good as expected from Dolby, and is loud. The phone has a classy look and the gradient colour at the back adds to it. Overall it's the best phone to buy at this price. Very satisfied.",24 June 2019,5

582,Amazon Customer,Such a package!,"Needless to say, loved the battery life on this one. I'm surprised as to how I have more than 50% battery left at the end of my day even after a good amount of mobile data+GPS being used(that too, without the power saving). I noticed that the fingerprint scanner physically moves a little bit though I haven't read if it's an intended feature but it seems cool since I have zero problems with it. The ultra-wide camera is a great experience. The low light camera quality can be improved as compared to other mid range phones. But I cannot complain since Samsung gives us so much in this price segment. The waterdrop notch looks appealing, the SUPER AMOLED display is something to talk about and the humongous 6GB RAM adds to the pleasure! I would 10/10 recommend!",18 June 2019,4
583,Amol Jadhav,Must buy,"After using 1 month.
1. Mobile display is awesome, no Chinese phone near to Samsung, after comparing to oppo, MI & vivo.
2. Battery is life too better, I'm normal user of YouTube , songs & calls, I charge mobile once in 2 days.
3. Samsung is using C type charger with support of fast charging, it will charge 100 within less time.
4. Camera, it's fine, can capture good photos, I have some photos with selfie and camera those are good. Except in low light with distance clarity will degrades.

Conclusion: Must buy if you want quality phone.",5 May 2019,5
584,anshuman Singh,One of the best value for money options,"So I Have been using this device for 2 months now and the best thing I liked about the device was its battery life. It lasts for 2 days easy despite using the phone for over 14hrs a day and yes that does include time spent on PUBG.
No lag in the graphics or with any apps and it it works seamlessly.
The camera quality is way above my expectations especially the front cam. The triple camera at the back allows you to take great pictures even in low light and is very quick even with the focus mode. The pro mode is very good for taking portraits and close ups
The display quality is crisp and the screen size is very good for watching movies and videos
I highly recommend this device to anyone looking for an overall great performing device",22 June 2019,5

586,HETANSHI,Best budget phone 😍😍,"""Samsung Galaxy M30 will be one of the first smartphones comes with triple camera in this 15000 to 20000 budget segment.Samsung Galaxy M30 is powered by a 1.6GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor that features 2 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and 6 cores clocked at 1.6GHz. It comes with 6GB of RAM.

The Samsung Galaxy M30 runs Android 8.1 Oreo and is powered by a 5,000mAh battery.

As far as the cameras are concerned, the Samsung Galaxy M30 on the rear has a 13-megapixel primary camera with an f/1.9 aperture; a second 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a third 5-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture. It sports a 16-megapixel camera on the front for selfies, with an f/2.0 aperture. This is great for someone who loves photography like me!

Overall, the phone is very fast and you can switch apps fast, multitask with ease! Great phone for a student like me""",11 March 2019,5
587,Rahul kumar,You won't find a better display in this budget,"I can comfortably state, and with conviction, that the Galaxy M30 has the best display (by some margin) on a phone that is priced under Rs 15,000. Samsung does make the best OLED panels for smartphones and it doesn't surprise me that the display on the Galaxy M30 is an absolute joy to look at.

The colours are punchy, the saturation levels are remarkable and the display gets bright enough to blind you for a few seconds if you suddenly flick the phone out of your pocket in the dark.
The Galaxy M30 packs a 5,000 mAh battery unit which lasts long for 2 days easily.
The phone packs a 13 MP f/1.9 primary camera supported by a 5 MP f/2.2 depth sensor and a 5 MP f/2.2 ultrawide-angle lens. Now, images shot in daylight turn out well with great contrast levels and natural-looking shades. Samsung does give you an easier way to turn on HDR but you can head to settings and turn that to 'Auto' if you like.",13 April 2019,5

It is a complete powerhouse with big battery and 15W fast charger. And its recent update of android pie with one ui make it to be comparable to A30. Samoled display provides you a best video experience. I feel only one problem with its face unlock but I sure the problem will fix with future updates.

When others trying to call my number, it shows busy/not-reachable most of the time. Rarely able to call others. Disappointed with this Samsung M30. Whenever i try to call, it shows ""Not registered on Network"" message. I changed SIM card. But still seeing same issue. SIM works fine with other handset.

it worked for 1st 15 days only. After that i started seeing the problem. Now only i confirmed that its not a SIM issue and only problem with Samsung M30 Mobile. Same inconsistency with mobile data network as well.

Bad experience. I lost many important calls due to this issue. Started using New handset now :(",21 June 2019,1
594,Riju Bharatheeyan,The phone cannot be used outside India- Shame,"We are a traveling family and we have recently purchased Samsung M30 and had travelled to UAE and disgustingly we could not use the phone out there because the phone is not meant to be used outside India? If Samsung has to sell the phone with country lock enabled, do it, but the customer should be informed about the restrictions beforehand so that we as a customer can chose the right brand. We switched from Mi phone to Samsung thinking that Samsung is more user-friendly and will be beneficial for us.

in terms of camera, the front camera is not really giving the right Image and really not meeting the expectation that we had from Samsung mid market phone.",10 June 2019,1
595,Pratyush G.,The most Honest and Accurate Review !,"This is the most honest and accurate review you will find.
1.The phone looks Amazing the touch and hold feel is excellent.
2 .Display, Sound quality is more than excellent.
3.Battery doesn't get charge fast .it takes time even with the fast charger. And lasts upto 12hrs of continuous use on full charge .
4.The phone has an heating issue .it warms up a bit.
5.The 6gb ram isn't worth the feel .
6.The Camera quality is just ok .For a camera guy or a selfie lover this phone is a big No !
7.The build quality is good and worth spending 18k .",30 May 2019,3
596,Amazon Customer,Best budget mobile with high end specifications,"Firstly after using this Samsung galaxy M 30 for few months I am writing this review..
Its battery I liked the most..with onetime full charging it works for 2 full days..
And rear camera it's really good..even at night..I liked the improved features provided by Samsung..
Front camera can be improved a bit in low light selfies..
Its face recognition is awesome..which randomly detects with no much delay..
And finger print sensor..its works very fine..
Even the back finish for the mobile is really good and eye catching..
Even it provided the update of latest android version..very happy for that
Those who want a mobile with a best battery backup and awesome look can go for this Samsung galaxy M30.",22 June 2019,5
597,Delhi user,Go for MI/VIVO in this price range,"Nutshell - MI/VIVO Users will not like this product because User Interface is comparatively not good.

All other users, read below:

Pros-
1.5 day life battery, full charge in 30-40 minutes, big screen, display colors, no pre installed apps. Triple tray ( 2 sim+Memmory card).

Cons- Touch is not smooth, Fingerprint is little slow, Auto brightness option is just mad, No cover or earphone in box. Also you can not stop camera shutter sound.

I am using this product since 1 month now, before I was on MI note 5 pro. And there is o comparison, no doubt MI beat this product in all areas except battery (4000 MAH vs 5000 MAH)",22 June 2019,5
598,Jolly,Likes and dislikes of Samsung M30,"I am using Samsung m30 from past 13 to 15 days Battery quality is good it stays for two days don't have to charge again and again, finger print censor is fine there is no lag in unlocking the handset, camera quality is pretty good with depth censor in the back and frontcamera however in low light images is not so clear, Amoled display is very good watching movies and photos is a treat, disappointed no dedicated music player app installed on the handset also sometimes handset gets unlocked automatically when there are apps running in the background
Overall the handset is good to buy with this price range.",18 June 2019,4
599,kumar,Worst worst worst phone dont buy this phone,Worst phone the year and samsung mobiles i purchased lost month 17th march. just 2 days ago display is totall white colour dilplay is automatic off is not warking,3 April 2019,1
600,Amazon Customer,Flash sale purchase,"I was excited to receive galaxy m30 on flash sale.. was confused on seeing 1 star reviews .. whether to buy it or not.. it has good camera performance in daylight.. but I felt camera performance is average in low light. I was disappointed bit as the OS is not android pie .and also it doesn't have notification light in it.. but I suggest if you don't like China model,its good to go for .",26 April 2019,4
601,Sesin Stephen,Worth money,"I purchased m30 on May 6th and used it for more than one and half month and noticed
Battey life is awesome
No problem with touch
Mic and speakers are sooth
Camera is innovative
Range reception is also proper

But the fingerprint scanner is not up the mark
Cam based brightness is lagging

But people are trying to degrade the phone too much
But still not a gamers phone",18 June 2019,5
602,Paree,Good phone with the good price,No where in the product description has mentioned that this phone can be used only in India. So after getting the phone I had to pay additional for unlocking the International code as I am using this phone out of India. Head phone is missing with the box however rest whatever I have ordered came in a good and working condition. So far the battery power is really good as i just charged once a day and it lasts for the whole day. Picture quality is really nice and value for money. Will update more feedback later as I have just purchased,17 June 2019,4
603,Ajithkumar B,Samsung Lover wouldn't miss M30,"I didn't expect a phone like this from Samsung....!, I really love it. But one thing I miss the trade mark feature of Samsung is the top class built quality(look wise, I thought it would be better looking) and iconic looks. The glass sandwich design, the unique design that stay away from other manufacturers, that design is now put down by samsung is a bit disappointment. But Finally got the nerves of Indian Consumers, especially in internals of the phone.....!

But being a Samsung lover, I like the older iconic design and present hardware and One UI (Which is the best from Sam). Using 3 Samsung Phones in my life till date, the striking AMOLED 😎😎😎 which is enough to me buy other flagship phone from Sam.!!!!! That's it!",21 June 2019,4
604,Sunil Velakurthi,Adventurous of late,"Samsung has suddenly become a lot more adventurous of late. There's been a flurry of launches over the past few months, and it looks like the Korean giant is catching on to the fact that it needs to innovate and jump on board with trends as they happen. We usually see new top-end features debut with the flagship Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series, and then trickle down to the mid-tier A-series and youth-focused J-series. For example, Samsung was one of the first to introduce tall, narrow Infinity Display screens, but it took ages for this well-received feature to show up on lower-tier offerings. Competitors caught on much sooner, and began selling low-cost phones that looked much more modern and sleek than Samsung's own.",18 June 2019,5
605,Ayan,Happy to buy,"I really liked this phone and I decided it to buy it for a long time. I am a movies and music lover more than a player so sAmoled display and Dolby atmos made the thing more beautiful. But the most amazing thing is the powerful battery and the speed of charging. The 15 watt charger charges the phone at the speed 4% per 5 mins. And the last thing i would like to say is the triple camera. Every photo have high pixel density and ultra wide camera is really awesome. You should definitely try this phone out. The only downfall of this phone is the processor. Exynos is and was never with par with snapdragon. But hope it will try to improve.
And i will recommend about the feature Always On Display. Its make it more fun.",13 March 2019,4
606,Ananthu,No other choice in this price range😍,The phone is simply amazing.... Best smartphone in this price range other than Chinese phones... It gives a premium feel and look. The display clarity is awesome and the touch feel and smoothness is very nice. Only small problem I felt is the fingerprint scanner.. Sometimes.. It is not working.. But it is not a serious issue... Moving to the camera section... I am really happy... The rear camera is just wow... It can even beat the high MP competitors... Bokeh effect is good... Selfie camera is a nice one... There is no any lagging or hangs... Phone is always fast and smooth.... Battery life is 😍 it is lot enough for a heavy day to day user... Overall... I love this smartphone we can always trust samsung. ❤,20 June 2019,4
607,parth,Best phone🔥,"Best phone with best affordable price, the best part of this phone is batter its a very much long lasting with best performance without any lag, so one can easily play any high graphic games without having any lag for example one can play pubg in HD graphics also games like gta, asphalt 9 are smooth working here.
Apart from this the camera quality with having many more features is also great, also the screen is super hd, so while watching a video or a movie we literally everything is real and we are into it. Also high quality speakers are awesome one can easily play loud music in noisy environment, and finger print unlocking system on screen itself makes the phone look smart. Samsung introducing this series with amazing features. It's the best i would surely recommend everyone thankyou samsung for such a great series.",15 March 2019,5
608,Shreyas patil,The one and only low budget smartphone.,"The display of the mobile is obviously awesome because of s amoled and not to worry of battery life because of exynos 7904 which is made by Samsung only for battery consumption and also have the best 360 degree sound surround system and camera pro feature also I like it and both camera are of best of quality, face lock and fingerprint are also very best unlocked mobile within a sec.",22 June 2019,5
609,nithin george,Worst product and worst service,"Worst productby Samsung.First experience from Samsung.i brought it through flash sale for my wife.she left to Australia after three days of receiving the same.Phone was already activated and talked 1 hr nearly in India with India sim.
While reaching Australia the phone is not working.its showing sim card locked.Lodged complaint with Samsung and followed the complaint for a month Samsung persons are finally concluding that the phone can be used in India only.
I used Samsung onmax and onnxt with lyca sim in 2018 on our visits. But a 2019 product is not working in a country like Australia.Samsung is technically degrading in every year i think.
I suggest everyone who are going overseas should not buy this crap.",15 June 2019,1
610,amit,excellent deal in amazon,"The phone is excellent in hardware configuration and very light weight.
The phone display is also very good and convenient to carry in pocket as it is very slim.
Go for Samsung M 30 rather if you are heavy day user not looking for phone for repeated charging.. because it has extremely high battery back up of 5000 mah.",15 March 2019,5
611,Amazon Customer,Review after the usage of 2 months.😊,"For this budget ,I feel like I am having the best phone in these range,I just love the wide and rear camera of this phone and it helps me to take cool videos and pictures as I am very fond of making videos. Battery life is good ,lasts for a day and even more hours. Fingerprint comes slowly at first and it became perfect by the first updates. Has good performance and the S-AMOLED display rocks , good video experience and the aesthetic is so nice. This phone is in a range of light weight. Loves everything except for the wide angle camera quality, it's only 5Mega pixel and not a good low light photography camera. Thanks Samsung for this phone.❤",18 June 2019,4
612,shivi,Cost Effective,"Phone is pretty much what's promised. It has 6GB Ram and 128 GB storage that makes it function smoothly. Although processor is exynos, which not on par with snapdragon, however it runs all applications and games effectively. At this price segment, one cannot expect to run Fortnite, which demands highly efficient GPU, but it play Modern strike , Critical Ops and PUBG effectively.
Camera quality is decent for day-to-day photography however one downside is that it has no front flash, so low light selfies are not great.
I prefered it because of Super Amoled panel and great battery life (5000 mah) which isn't available in any other phone in this segment.
Overall, It justifies its cost.",29 June 2019,5
613,alok kumar,For Heavy Gaming a straight no - Processor is not built for heavy games like PUBG,"Review after few days of usage :--

Out of the Box - Looks Premium in hand

Pros - Super Amoled Display , with Notch display is a plus
Tripple camera in this price is icing on the cake
5000 MAH battery with Fast charging option is double plus ( Goes one day with moderate game play )

COns- Processor could have been better
Game lags can happen
Play PUBG at lowest settings only ( still lags)
Finger print sensor could have been placed at optimum place, slightly on the upper side

Overall - Best phone in the budget with all the features ( avoid if you want to play PUBG)",26 April 2019,4
614,Rainy Mox,Got Mobile in bend condition and front camera not working,"I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M30 through Amazon flash sale on 26th March and it had a bend on the top right corner of the phone. Also, the front camera doesn't work. As a tech giant, Samsung should examine the product quality. Quality inspection is not certain. On the other side, lots of time wasted for clarifying the bend issue to the amazon customer care executive and at last by downloading the blancco app the issue regarding the front camera was detected not the bend. Thus the phone returned and not replaced by the lack of mobile from the seller(the effect of the flash sale). I am not satisfied with the amazon customer care because many calls were to be done for clarifying the problem.",4 April 2019,1
615,Amazon Customer,A treat on a budget!!!,"I bought Samsung galaxy M30 over a month ago.. this has been my best phone so far...the display is brilliant...the camera quality is outstanding...though the phone is big in size I got used to it in couple of days..

The battery back up is crazy...at time I don't have to worry upto 3 days to charge it...the blue light filter helps me use the phone longer as it doesn't strain my eyes...

I love the colour of the phone...its very classy...finger print reader is very quick and easily accessible...

The speaker is decent...but the Dolby atmos sound takes it to another level...I love watching videos on it...

Overall it's an exceptional phone at this price",20 June 2019,5
616,Amazon Customer,"Product good, Amazon as usual.","Phone is as per expectation. Screen size, sensitivity, battery is awesome. However, not sure about how much is the cat LTE, camera is good in daylight, brokenh is good.
Service of Amazon is not good. Person who brought my phone, didn't had a machine for card payment, I had to manage cash like a roadshow 😐. He asked me for Google pay which I don't have. They used to give a call before delivering products which they've stopped.",27 April 2019,5
617,AKHIL GUPTA,"Amazingly awsm phone, but lacks good low light video recording.","I got the product delivered on 22nd april. And i will review this phone as per my usage till today..

Display
Battery (with intense use for full day streaming ,i have 25-30% battery for the next day)
Camera
Fingerprint
Speakers r good... not bad at all

While few shortcomings in terms of
Low light video recording
Face recognition (as it opens on eyes closed)

618,RUPALI,Best Budget Phone,"I have been using Samsung M30 for more than one month, its been so far good experience. Firstly you get amoled screen in this price which is a bonus. Once I forgot charger in office but still I was able to stay till next day as it got massive 5000mah battery with a quick charging, USB C is bonus too. Nowadays everyone gives loads of RAM, but I trust 4GB ram from Samsung, its not always about 4gb or 6gb size, its the quality and performance from chipset matters. I also like the One UI core is very clean and easy. The best thing is it got Dolby sound, have a great earphones and the output is so good. I got update of Andriod 9 and its so good to get that early. I am a happy Samsung M30 user",20 June 2019,5
619,AD,"Good With battery life, reliability.","Like- battery issue resolved, with connected bluetooth device and playing uTube not heats up much battery- which was not the case with other mobiles. Regid reliable supporting hardware to software I,e. Android.

its not dislike but now days people are more into bluetooth ear phones, so should providing same with mobile itself with an option to do so.",18 June 2019,5
620,Bramhapurikar H.,Happy and average mixed,"Awesome display.
Sleek and slim phone.
Stomach full of battery lasts really very long.
Very fast action.
Good feature of Samsung internet to save data.
Blue light filter is a very innovative idea

One side speaker
Dolby only on earphone
Radio only on earphone
Worst screen capture by together pressing power and volume buttons.

Moto g4 plus and Lenovo k4 note vibe far more easy to handle",18 June 2019,3
621,Vinitha VS,Highly Not recommended,Disappointed.. its sound is too low.. getting struck... my old phone is galaxy on5 pro... it was too good... m30 is aworst phone.. I have 5yr son.. he always take my phone. That's why I choose only samsung phones. It has less radiation compared to other branded phones. But this m30 is a worst phone. Very pathetic performance.,29 April 2019,1
622,Sindhupandi,Worth money..,"Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone. I love it",20 June 2019,5
623,Vineet Neoliya,Wonderful phone. Best among competitors,"The phone is really good. Processing speed is good.
The only thing that is lacking in the phone is good camera quality and fingerprint sensor is not that active.
But in all the ways one can rate the phone 10/10.
Hope the phone continues to run in a smooth way for long time, as it has only been a month now.
But yes, one can analyze the features and quality in a week.
So overall, I would say it is a nice phone and looks great.
Cheers.",18 June 2019,5
624,SP,Overall ok deal,"I personally like its UI experience. I am not fond of games so didn't tried any games as such. But phone response is quite good. 90 mins for full charge and then goes 1.5 days of moderate to heavy usage. Camera quality is average.
For my type of usage, I should have opted M20 which is at quite lower price.",11 March 2019,4
625,Raghu,"Go for it if not a heavy gamer, all else boxes it ticks.","Overall a nice package for the price, 2 to 3k for the brand and continued software support. Pie update and another update done with manual check and update option, performing flawless after update. While setup please choose which apps to install or not. With conservative use phone can last 4 days with proper settings to avoid battery drain. Purchased another phone after a week, both devices working fine, charge speed is quite good no worry there. Oled display, pie update, 5000 mah battery, wide angle and portrait cameras are the pros. Cons, processor not for heavy gaming, oled display costly to replace, use good bumper case. Amazon fast and safe delivery, no issues.",21 June 2019,5
626,Harsh Rawat,You can do better,"The face recognition is fast, image stabilization is very bad,
Cons: It doesn't have samsung pay, camera not worth the money, no nfc

627,amit,Good phone but could have been better given the price range,"All in all its a good budget phone.
The battery life is very good,the device stays up for the whole day when charged once in the morning
Fingerprint sensor is bit of a disappointment as it takes around 2-3 seconds to recognize and unlock the device
The camera is good and takes amazing photographs with low light.
The display is good which provides hd streaming for various platforms like netlflix,prime etc. The screen to display ratio is very less which means the whole screen is almost the display of the screen.
One upsetting feature is its design..its got a plastic body which is very prone to damages and does not give a very nice look and feel.",18 June 2019,4
628,Vijayakumar Singaram,Go ahead for Samsung M30 blindly !!,"M30 is a Beast model in this price segment.
I admire this phone for following reasons,
- Firstly the radiation, the SAR value is around ~0.4 only where other phones are more than one.
- There is not much heating issue for an average user.
- Battery back lasts atleast 30hours in one shot charging for good usage.
- Phone is best specification in this price segment and ofcourse its Samsung first ever leap to launch a phone in this price with heavily loaded options.
- Triple camera does the Job pretty well. It has wide angle lenses to capture big landscapes as well.
Output is much better in day light.
Night photography is average.",18 June 2019,5
629,Divyansh,"Nice, cool is it?","What i like in this mobile phone is its screen. Which is way better than any other company is providing, camera quality isn't good but front camera will not let u down.
Battery is the second most thing you can love about this phone.
One UI update is here, believe it or not samsung is killing it. If your main purpose isn't camera and if you cannot buy galaxy A50, you should go for this one. It is way awesome than i described it",18 June 2019,4
630,Ved Mohan,Pretty good budget phone,"Pretty good phone for the price. Pubg does lag and phone does get slow at times. But considering the price, the performance is average. Camera is basic, nothing great. Display is pretty good. Battery backup is good too. Should last a whole day even with heavy usage. Fast charging does disappoint though. Takes 3 hours to completely charge from 10 % to 100%. Visibility in sunlight is very poor. Speaker is also okay. Overall value for money phone in the budget phone segment.",7 April 2019,4

633,Deepak,Great purchase at Great price,"Firstly I would like to say that the UI is so good and buttery smooth with no lag at all since it is optimized thanks to Samsung for that.
The battery backup is so great I could go on watching videos from morning 10 AM to night 11 PM and the battery still remains at 24%👍.The camera is quite good I haven't tried Google camera yet but stock camera is ok but you need to focus for 2-3 secs for good images.Fingerprint reader is not so fast it takes nearly 1sec to unlock but since you cannot do anything in just a sec it's bearable😄.However it's not that great for gaming heavy graphic games,I would recommend this for only heavy media/entertainment consumers😁",23 May 2019,5
634,Bhadresh,A great device with very good features!!😊,"The device is awesome and feels so good to hold it in hands!! The camera is great too because of wide angle its very helpful to click wide range scenes! The fingerprint sensor is very quick, just a quick tap unlocks the device! And just loved the battrey life because I don't have much time to charge my phone! Other than that I also liked the idea of dedicated sim slot... the screen also works well and the device doesn't hangs! It runs smoothly.. i was afraid to buy Samsung due to some bad experiences in past with samsung mobile phones but i will tell you that this phone is just great in each and everything!",20 June 2019,5

Good battery backup. Samsung UI is really good and pie update available on the first day itself.. user experience also good.
Negative things
Camera not upto the mark. All photos taken rear and front looks like edited image.. poor quality. Performance not upto the level. Some lacks are there while interchanging the app. I expect 6 GB ram and new processor would be effective. But I felt that processor performance not upto the level.

Because once the product is received you cant do anything. I contacted around 4-5 time to amazon and spoke 1 and half hour once they said that there is no return option at all. they says you can only use the mobile even if you dont have that feature you are looking for.

The fingerprint reader is good.

The camera quality is good but doesn't provide the expected image quality especially during low light.

Battery backup is best we need to charge only once in 24 hrs after a lot of usage. Sensor is also good. It has a led display which is perfect.

Yeah , the cam is bad , really bad , and the ultrawide shot is a gimmik.
Screen is excellent. Speakers are great. Can't say about battery life , only got it 2 days ago. But seems adequate.
Charging has been surprisingly fast considering the 5000mah battery. Around 2 hrs for a full charge.

The 6.4 inch S amoled infinity U display with 5000mAh battery life makes it perfect for multimedia and gaming. Last but not the least, all this at a fantastically reasonable rate, workmanship of Samsung with made in India tag makes it an immediate BUY.",18 June 2019,5

There is no vibration intensity, you won't notice even your phone is ringing
You can't forward your messages to your recent contacts, there is no option at all
Call ending button is not working properly, you need press twice or thrice to end the call
Look wise is also, it is not that much good, it look alike a cheaper phone when you hold on your hand.
Though the configuration sounds great, it is actually a low end phone
Better don't buy this phone, it is completely waste of money",30 May 2019,1

649,Ayush purohit,"Display,battery life",The phone is smooth...You cant compare it display with any other phone at this price point..Fingerprint scanner in good...face recognition dont work when eyes are closed..And ofcourse one can play pubg on this device...pubg play doesnt offer those high settings but when you compare another device with same settings the there is clear day light..I mean it looks better on M30..All in all its agreat phone...With best battery backup...2 hours of pubg play only consumes about 25pecents of battery...so its a great phone..,24 May 2019,5
650,chandrasekhar tekur,Great looking phone but software hangs occasionally,"The phone looks great and build quality is good. So far I couldn't get good photos out of it, not sure if the problem is with settings or the camera itself though I used default settings. Another problem I have been experiencing is the phone hangs sometimes, it just doesn't respond to touch. after upgrading to Pie the frequency of phone hangs reduced but it occurs occasionally.",5 June 2019,4

It has a fast charger out of the box thats good the sound has more treble and it can be better , the camera is just awesome within this range and beats the huawei quite easily , The phone gets heated up slightly on the first time charge but eventually cools down, samsung has removed it's earphones which is a downside however it has the type c usb port making it a unique model within its price segment and it is a tough competition when comparing but if you are going to buy this it is an excellent choice",15 April 2019,5

667,Amazon Customer,Not at all durable.. Samsung using cheap quality material..,This phone is not at all durable.. Samsung is using cheap materials to reduce the price.. I dropped the phone while sitting in a chair inside the office and the display was gone.. it was not a huge fall and more over there was a tempered screen and case.. there was no physical damage to the tempered glass.. only a minor scratch on the display.. Samsung service centre charged me 6000 rs for replacing the display.. this is absolutely pathetic.. there are phones much cheaper and durable for the given price.. don't go for this phone or any other M series phone for that matter..,1 July 2019,1
668,sundeep,Honest Review after 2 months usage.,"Fingerprint reader works fine. Camera clarity is just fine. Battery life is too good will easily last for 2 days on moderate use and 1.5 day for heavy users and gamers.

Overall , I give 3.5 out of 5 interms of build quality, sound, camera and durability.
The best thing about the fone is its screen _ Samsungs Super Amoled screen really Rocks !!!
BATTERY is second considering point.",18 June 2019,4

Since I keep my internet on all the time, I was doubtful about the advertised battery life. After using this phone for more than a month, I am totally satisfied with the battery life. On an average, a single charge gives me two days of battery backup !
Camera is good in daylight but not that good in low light.
Overall, a very good phone for the price !",15 May 2019,5

Within that short period of use, the fingerprint reader was not quick. The quality of the pictures taken was below average. I don't want to talk about battery life as it lasted only 6 hrs.

Brand new phone first time usage it's giving problem and how can you ask this!!!! Even if it works it'll give problem in the near future. Very disappointed with amazon than this product.

676,Amazon Customer,Nice but camera should imrpove waiting for the Update,"It's a quite dissopointment, what I was expected in before buy and after buy, camera should improve... No need to release with similar products from samsung, release 2 or 3 with the great features and we are ready to pay whatever the cost. Because I am big fan of samung... But Samsung M30 it's not reached my expectations... Only the problem is Camera. Without everything is fine. I don't want discuss other features of this mobile... Because my only interest to buy this product CAMERA only... But finally it was 2/5 rating for camera.",26 June 2019,3

I choose this as compare to A50 because A50 has screen touch unlock that is not fast as rear finger print scanner

678,Sonia,Lowered my expectations for Samsung,"I'm been using this product for a month now.
What's quite surprising is, after clicking nearly 100 images, I see only 1image in the gallery. I checked it everywhere, including file manager but the images just vanish. Secondly, can anyone tell me the lifetime of the battery. I use WhatsApp insta almost all day.. and the battery dies till the end of the day. Ain't it supposed to last for 2-4days without charge ?
Thirdly, when I open the camera, I see a black display which comes n goes quite often.
Dont feel the worth of this product after paying 18k. What's the process of exchange after a month ?",20 May 2019,2
679,Kaustubh Bhat,The best phone in Stores,"The Samsung Galaxy M30 has a gorgeous AMOLED screen and looks just awesome from the front. The front camera resides in a U-shaped notch, which is inconsequentially smaller than most of the phones out there in the market. Morever it adds a gradient finish to spice things up. Galaxy M30 is super comfortable to wield. The battery backup on the Galaxy M30 is excellent. The phone can easily last for a day of heavy usage, it supports fast charging -and- Samsung also bundles a fast charger in the box. Also its weight is so less that when I carry it in my jeans, I hardly feel that its a phone which is the most important thing for a college student like me. I love it.",24 March 2019,5
680,Rakesh,Awesome phone. Satisfied.,"Excellent phone. Huge battery life, stands for one full day with continuous use. For camera I'll give 3/5, not poor nor excellent. SAMOLED Display scores outstanding. Crystal clear. I worried about camera performance before buying, but I'm satisfied(not gaming user). The main reason for buying Samsung is to avoid Chinese product. And also this is Indian make. Very much satisfied. Premium look. Notification LED not available, that's the one disadvantage. Unable to use/ save memory card storage for WhatsApp/WPS office, this is another disadvantage. Overall satisfied.",13 May 2019,4

This device contains 4gb ram, so u can install many apps. Battery will last long as it is 5000mAH,the main advantage of this phone is its battery life.Rear camera has 13mp+ 5mp+ 5mp. It also has light sensor and proximity sensor which is quite good. It has 64gb internal storage , which you can even expand. This phone design is absolutely fantastic and its very comfortable to hold it in hands. So if u have a budget of 15, 000 rs , I will recommend you to buy this phone.",18 June 2019,5

You are here just beacause you like the phone but i am here to tell you about some drawbacks of this phone.
1.It do have a 5000 mah battery but battery life is not that great. A heavy user like me can't expect anything more than 4000 mah on other phones.
2.It do have camera same as a20 but you can record 4k in it, slow motion in it but not in this phone. Even tough that phone have an inferior chip. Also please note that this phone's chip do supprt upto 4k recording.

695,Santosh,Heating issue while on calls,The only problem i see is heating. It gets heated even for a basic use i.e. is on calls. 15 mins in call and the phone upperside will heat up so badly that it will be difficult to continue using the phone. Its so damn uncomfortable and dangerous. This appears to be a flaw in the handset which Samsung doesnt agree to.

I would recommend a case and tempered glass protector. The sAmoled display is really great and is must for people like me who watch a lot of videos on their phones.

And the long battery is great too, don't have to charge for the entire day which Im sure is a problem that most of my college friends face.

Cons: Finger print sensor is a bit at a height for people with small hands. But comfortable for adults.
Remarks: Better than redmi and nokia phones. I purchased it after one and half months research",19 April 2019,4
707,Gaurav Jadhav,Budget Phone with good battery life,"Pros-
Worried about carrying portable charger and power banks while traveling. This phone provides 5000mAh battery, still keeping the phone light weighted. The triple camera is just fine in image quality. Photo capturing is fast. Performance is fine

Cons
Heating issues for exynos processor and some lag in speed.
Better to go for snapdragon phones like samsung M40",30 May 2019,5
708,Amazon Customer,Review after using M30 for 2.5 months,"No issues with camera, battery and display. Totally happy with those but the processor is slow AF. The phone is getting slower each day to a point where it takes around 5sec to receive a call. You cannot play PUBG properly. It's playable under low graphics that too provides low fps. Fingerprint reader got very slow now.. I don't even remember that there is a option of face unlock. Earlier it was working fine but now it takes more than 5-6 sec to unlock. DON'T BUY IT GUYS. I am trying to exchange with some other phone but Amazon has not added this phone in their exchange phones list",25 May 2019,2
709,Chandra Kanta Samanta,Excellent budget smartphone to compete all Chinese brands,The product meets all my expectations and it is flawless and smooth till now. It has excellent and improved UI with a huge battery. The camera quality under this budget range is good. The overall performance could compete with all these Chinese brands.

711,Vikram Kanwar,Slow and Hangs,"Its quite slow. To share an image it takes time to show options like whatsapp, mail, bluetooth etc etc. Not expected in a 4gb phone. I have used only 37% of internal storage and there is ample storage available so there should not be any reason for slow performance. Also sometime Apps are not functioning properly. The same App with same account and same broadband connection is working properly on another brand phone but doesn't work properly in Samsung M30. Camera quality is just average.",1 May 2019,2

713,Akhildev,Good Quality Product,The one negative part I felt is the camera quality. Sometimes the quality of rear camera is lil low. also getting some grain particles while capturing. also the 3rd cam feels like fish eye lens while capturing the wide angle pics.,18 June 2019,4
714,Vishal Menariya,Battery backup,"I liked each nd every feature of the phone nd specially the long or large 5000mAH battery life
Fingerprint reader is also good it detects my finger even when my finger got rough during summer it is too good
Which remains whole day even I perform too many tasks like chating surfing playing high end games like PUBG mobile.....
In camera I like the most is wide angle picture mode and the camera quality is also amazing
According to me this phone is best under the budget of 15000
Thnx Samsung Electronics for such cool mobile phone and keep the game going",19 June 2019,5

717,Vissu Choudhary,Awesome but Samsung should updated the processor,"In this price segment I personally found Samsung Galaxy M30 awesome however here are some ups and down below

1. BATTERY: 5000Mah battery lasts whole day on heavy usage but when it came to gaming like running PUBG it drain very fast, this might be because of processor's higher power consumption.

2. Processor: Samsung should enhance the processor so that it be on top for PUBG gamers too.

3. Camera: I found camera satisfactory however it not work as in low light as per expect.

4. Face unlock: works very slow in comparison of Realme or Redmi.",2 June 2019,4
718,Bhaskar Saha,Phone is Just Awaesome. Fully Satisfied.,Samsungs sAmoled displays are just awaesome. The main highlights of this phone is the display which i think is fantastic in this price range and also the triple rear camera which we are getting in this range below 15k. Overall a good phone for moderate user not so good for heavy gamers because the processor is not that good but for daily use and light gaming its one of the best phones on this price range.,22 March 2019,5

Battery life is good - 4.6 out of 5",14 April 2019,4
720,Kandarp,A phone worth buying!,"Samsung Galaxy M30 is an amazing phone with super AMOLED display ,16M colors with 6.4 inch(88.1 screen to body ratio).The resolution is 1080*2340 pixels. The battery life is also amazing with 5000mAh, it can literally work for days on standby and with continuous use for over a day atleast. There are 3 main cameras with depth sensors and HDR quality.
Adding on to it is the chipset which is Exynos 7904 Octa. 4 GB RAM works perfectly good and is fast enough. Samsung Galaxy M30 is one of the best phones at such a great price. I would highly recommend you to buy this product",11 March 2019,5
721,Guru Prasad,Not upto the mark!,"Build quality is plastic which bears scratches easily. Display is sAMOLED but it's warmer when compared to A series. Limited support to Samsung Apps viz, Samsung pass, Secure folder, Samsung pay mini, Bixby, etc are not supported to M series. Easy to hold as it has less weight though it has 5000 mAh battery. Front camera always smoothes the image and detail is not great. Camera is good under daylight conditions. Go for A30 which is far better than M30.",20 June 2019,4
722,Anurag Uniyal,Satisfying,"I bought it just two days back.
My previous phone was moto g 4 plus bought back in 2015.
Samsung is a brand but I feel this phone is just satisfying.
Display is great. Camera quality is great. But the small features which was provided by moto g is not provided by Samsung.
So it's ok to buy it but nothing so special about it",22 June 2019,3
723,Paulomi Parekh,"Great Price, Much Recommendable!",The phone is super light & is offered at a really good price. Nice sleek design. The blue gradient color is the ne to look out for. The camera is pretty amazing & the display is quite impressive & making it an amazing view to have. The 5000 mAh battery lasts for almost two days on one full charge. The display is crystal clear & can work when used in direct sunlight. The signature feature is the wide angle mode of the phone. The battery life on the other hand is long enough to work over. Even though the battery is low it charges quickly to enjoy it again. It possesses almost all the features of a professional camera.,13 March 2019,5
724,Jags,Amazing and Awesome,"Only likes, no dislikes. This phone has changed my negative perception about Samsung phone. In the Past I used to use Samsung Duos which used to get hanged and I would get frustrated every now and then. This phone is doing really excellent job. Camera, Battery, Fingerprint reader, Security patches, overall design any many more features that I might not know are all awesome. At the price of 15k, this is the best one in this segment and I would recommend everyone to go for it.",21 June 2019,5
725,Amazon Customer,Think thrice before purchasing M30,"Battery drains rapidly although I never play games nor use it for watching videos or play music. Finger print reader is very very slow sometimes it takes more than two three touch to read. Although it is 6GB variant, the performance is not up to the mark with basic Apps installed. If you move certain 3rd party Apps from device storage to SD card then you won't be able to update the Apps till you uninstall and again reinstall the App in device storage.",28 May 2019,1
726,Delwin Joel Goveas,Overall Good One,"The pros of this device is the display, battery, type-C port. Hardware wise this one is good device but when it comes the software it's little bit disappointing, the camera software processing is not good, no image stabilization camera needs to be improve a lot. The camera has got good hardware but software is not upto the mark Samsung should improve the camera software in coming updates. Please Samsung push good software update.",9 April 2019,5

729,Madhurjya Chowdhury,"""SAmSunK""","I got duped by the brand name, could have got a better deal hadn't I got sucked into this brand facade. There is some software glitch in this phone sometimes you can't make calls unless u restart it. And the other issue is when u take the phn out of your pocket either the torch is on or your bluetooth is active or some other such crap meaning it doesn't have a pocket mode like one plus. Signal strength is also not too impressive.",10 May 2019,3
730,Rohith MS,My first Samsung.,"This is my first Samsung smartphone. Samsung's budget smartphone literally has got everything.
The AMOLED display is excellent.
Great battery life.
Samsung gave no compromise on camera quality.
The wide angle lens is just amazing.
The fingerprint sensor has not been upto the mark.But I don't find it difficult.
The other thing is that it is not a gaming phone.
But games work fine in moderate mode.
In my opinion this is one of the best smartphone below Rs20,000.
I also recommended this phone to my cousin and he uses it.",18 June 2019,5

little improvement required in touch sensors at the corners( while using YouTube while enlarging the vedio it takes very little time for getting enlarged but that's fine......
Screen quality, awesome
network antenna very good even in area with low signals it can catch the signal and provides good connectivity .

734,abhimonyu,Price Perfect - Usage not so,"It's an okayish package but having used a OnyPlus phone prior to this (that also an ancient model like OnePlus X), I am somewhat disappointed by the super Amoled display and touch receptiveness. The display could have been better. A OnePlus X Amoled display was so much better than a claimed SuperAmoled display of this phone. Also, few notification buttons are not as touch reactive as they should be. These things kind of kill the edge but I am reminded of the price at which this model comes along and overall, I guess the feedback would be ""satisfactory """,13 May 2019,4
735,Sreeram,Value for Money,If you want a phone with long battery life with top class display. This mobile is one to watch for.Could have made a provided a better rear camera similar to a50 with a good supporting lowlight features. Selfie camera is good compared to rear camera. Android pie version and one ui available in update.But it is a good value for money compared to a quick obsolete budjet phomes which will wear off after 2 years.

748,Akhil Arora,M30 or redmi note 7 pro,"The only reason i bought it over Redmi note 7 pro is because of its front camera . yeah it has more battery life , fast charger bundled with it and better display than 7 pro but that hardly matters. Note 7 pro has better processor , excellent design and better UI. i would have bought redmi note 7 pro but as it is a gift for someone who is selfie obsessed , i went for M30.

Speaker is fine

Things which I didn't liked:
Camera is ordinary

The phone is fast and I love the Samsung UI. I had options like Redmi Note and Realme3 having much better processors but I made the right choice by trusting Samsung on this one. The only downside is that the camera becomes slow at night but using it with flash and ignoring the slow capture, the camera quality is at it's best.",20 June 2019,5

The FHD+ AMOLED display looks and feels better as compared to other smartphones. Good for gaming, as 6GB RAM works perfectly with exynos 7904 chipset and gives you very good gaming experience.

779,Amazon Customer,"Go for it, blindly!!","Amazing speed and finest features within medium budget, makes Samsung M30 unique. It has great finger print sensor readers and decent camera qualities. What amuses me is its battery life. It charges very quickly (10 mins to reach more than 30-40% battery life) and runs for 2 two days!!! Whatelse we need ? Ask for more and you would get it for less cost, from Samsung. Mind you, Samsung produces the least SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) i.e. low radiation emitting phones!",19 June 2019,5
780,Debjyoti,Simply beast at this price point,I using this phone roughly 3 mnth and i would say this is the best budget oriented samsung which have excellent battery back up and display.

783,cbananth,"Received damaged,dented item",Received damaged product. There was a dent across the sim card tray. Unfortunately I was not in town to receive the phone. By the time i came back and unpacked the phone it was beyond the return duration. It is unbelievable that a brand like Samsung can pack damaged item and sell it as brand new,13 April 2019,1
784,Jayendra Mori,Had to replace the first device I received,I received a faulty device at first which was hanging and restarting at will from the first setup process itself. I must say Amazon customer service is really good. They listen to my issue try debugging via remote access and then sent a technician to check the device and he confirmed it was faulty. Within two days I received a new device. Overall the device is value for money. Great battery life amazing display and touch good camera quality good performance so far. I am a basic user and don't use heavy apps and games.,18 June 2019,4
785,Siyad,I think there was a problem with the processor.,"Battery life is awesome. Camera and display is good. But the main thing in a phone is processor. I think exynos processor is not up to the mark. Some apps is crashing and the network speed is slow. If we consider the health of our body, this phone is a better choice, because this is a phone with a low SAR value. M30 is one of the lowest SAR value smart phone available in indian market.",3 July 2019,3
786,Senthilkumar Karunakaran,Not the best phone in this segment.

Rest of the features like I said b4 r ok nothing great to mention or write about. Samsung just fooled ppl believing into about this product's big things. But I must say this product is value for money. Meant for less tech savvy ppl and not for hardcore cellphone lovers going for high end specifications and tech savvy guys. Good for gifting in family.,10 June 2019,3
793,Akash Popli,Inconsistent performance,"The product is not responding almost every third attempt so it's functions are not working as designed or rather they are not consistently working.
