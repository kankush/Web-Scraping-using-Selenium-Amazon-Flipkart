CONS :-
--------
1) Cameras are above average, I was expecting even better Quality output.

4) Position of Finger print sensor.
5) Ton of bloatware.

VERDICT :--
------------
According to my usage if you are a Normal User ,then there's NO NEED to upgrade to this phone if you already have Edge 7.
For this Price, it has Everything. Performance, Quality, Durability and aesthetic. Have few downfalls, but the quality and performance overshadows them. I also got chance to use S8+ and Note 8, so I felt S8 is best among all for Normal user and has better Value for Money ratio.
Luxury has a Price and this tag is justified, you can certainly go for it.

9,Vivek,Samsung Galaxy S8,"Hello,

I want to write a review on my long awaited smartphone - the Samsung Galaxy S8. I bought it in March 2019 for a discounted amount of 27K with exchange, & is absolutely worth it! Here's why:

* Premium flagship phone with superb build quality, made of metal & covered with Gorilla glass 5 all around (front & back)
* Wide QHD + Super AMOLED Infinity display, with razor sharp 2940x1440 resolution & curved display
* Bixby voice assistant
* IP68 rated dust-proof and water-proof
* Wireless charging
* Brilliant 12MP rear camera & reasonably good 8MP front camera
* Very good speaker sound quality
* Premium AKG earphones
* Adaptive fast charging
* Advanced security features like face unlock & iris scanner, along with traditional methods like fingerprint sensor & pattern/pin lock

Many of the above mentioned features are unavailable in ""budget flagship"" smartphones like the Oneplus 6T. Also, I got it for almost 10K less than the Oneplus 6T, as the S8 was being sold at a discounted price with exchange offer.

Please do note that the smartphone is a fingerprint magnet & the position of the fingerprint scanner is awkward - very near to the rear camera & hard to reach.

Also, there are complaints that the backup from the 3000 mAh battery is poor, although I found it good enough. Still, if you want to conserve battery life, you can always use the ""Max battery life"" mode, lower the brightness & lower the resolution to HD+ from WQHD+.

The display is absolutely the best of any smartphone out there, excellent for watching movies & videos in very high resolution & superb color reproduction.

Hope this small review helps you in making your S8 buying decision easier :)",5

Used one plus 3 earlier with 6 gb of ram earlier but this despite being a 4gb one performs better than the one plus 3 and even the one plus 6. The device is premium and Flipkart's delivery was on point. Love this device, the curve diaplay will make your eyea pop and bring more vibrant colours to your pictures. Playing PUBG is a bliss and snappy on the S8. The camera is awesome. All in all this is really a banger. Go ahead and buy it, its definitely worth your money.",5

25,Nikhil Mishra,Highly recommended,"This is the review you should read before buying this phone.
I have been using this phone for over a month, and I'm going to cover every single point.

PROS:

Design: It looks premium, feels premium and it is THE PREMIUM phone. Every person that held it in hand admired it's design. No one ever said I should have bought other phones like iPhone or OnePlus for this much money. Design is a big plus point. Also, red colour is just super beautiful.

Screen: Absolutely gorgeous. True to life colours make it look like everything is real. Brightness is high for outdoor viewing. Samsung's Super AMOLED panel is the thing to beat.

Performance: Snapdragon 845 is out, but Exynos 8895 is no slouch. Everyday tasks, gaming, browsing everything is super fast. Samsung Experience UI is not like TouchWiz, it's super beautiful and does not lag this phone. 4GB RAM is enough for multitasking and keeps apps running in background.

Camera: So y'all think Samsung's Camera can be beaten? No. This Camera is just on another level. I heard they have improved on S9 but Camera on S8 is already so good. Whether it's daytime or nighttime, pictures are always clear. Great audio recording, OIS and 4K it's got everything.
Front Camera has auto focus that's very rare and it's good.

Battery: I really do not know if battery life is a PRO or CON. I am a heavy user, like really heavy user. It gives me SOT of around 4.5-6 hours, that's good for a heavy user but Standby is something that can't be ignored and yes standby time is not that good, loses around 4-6 percent in 12 hours.

Updates: Yes, it receives monthly security updates and it will receive Android P as well.

Other Essentials: It's got a rare thing called headphone jack, very very impressive AKG earphones, always on display, LED notification light, USB type C, and IP68 rating - Water and Dust resistant.

CONS:

Battery: Charging time is not 75 or 80 minutes as other people say. Sometimes it takes over 3 hours to charge, sometimes it charges in 100 minutes. I have never seen it charging in less than 100 minutes.

Heating: Yes, it heats. I don't know what makes it heat. One day Subway surfers can make it heat, other day it won't. That's not very often but it does heat. One day I had to put it in the fridge to cool it down.

I guess that's it. Please ask a question if you want to know anything. It's your money, you should know it's worth spending or not.",5

48,Mukesh Kukrani,Worth every penny,"I bought this phone during the Big Diwali Sale for 33K INR and it was a steal deal for me. Starting with the phone, this phone is last year's flagship from Samsung and doesn't even seems old or outdated even now. Mostly, because of it's display, both front and back glass design, good cameras, and a compact form-factor. Although 2018 has seen too much of full-screen and 18:9 displays, but what Samsung has offered with this device is an AMOLED Panel with 18.5:9 aspect ratio, which still holds up to this time and believe me it's still better than the displays found on One Plus 6 & 6T, Vivo V11 Pro and Oppo F9 Pro. Coming to the design aspect of this, I love the design and the overall form factor, I'm mostly a 'one handed user' and that is the only reason I wanted a S8 and not S8 Plus, so the design is compact and feels great even with one hand use(I found it a little tall for one hand use, but that can be adjusted and one gets used to it after a while). I haven't spent much time on Camera's, but so far so I can say that they perform good, produce a good image quality and has a good dynamic range. And since I haven't spent much time on Cameras, I don't want to compare it with any other smartphone on this aspect. Although, these are the major takeaway points for this phone, but there's more to it. I list down a couple of features as Pro's, which I think this phone has an advantage of. Pro's -: Infinity Display. Wireless Charging. Support for Fast Charging via Type-C. Decent Camera Performance. IRIS Scanner for Unlocking the device(Which I believe is faster than One Plus's and Vivo's In-Display Fingerprint Sensors). Last but not the least and crucial for me, I'm in love with this Burgundy Red Colour, I only bought this phone specially because of this colour, it looks so stunning and attractive. This was out of stock after a while when the big billion days started and it seemed that the stocks won't return now and I might have to opt for the basic black one, but I wasn't ready to shed out my money for the black one instead of this. And believe me as soon as I saw this one back in stock, I ordered it rightaway. It's a Unisex Colour, I would only recommend this colour if someone is opting for this phone. Also, the performance is good and I haven't used a One Plus as a primary phone in my life, so couldn't actually tell them about the performance comparisons but I truly believe it can outperform those Vivo's and Oppo's. Also one another thing I liked about this phone is that, Samsung Health. A distinctive application in-built in the smartphone, which allows users to record their Water & Food Intakes, record their Heart Rate, Stress and Oxygen Saturation(SpO2) via a Heart Rate Sensor present at the rear of the phone(besides camera). Also it records your Sleep Time and you can add your Workout Session, Walking Sessions, Aerobic Sessions, etc which in-all could help you know better about your body and get you fit. The app also offers you Exercise Programmes depending upon your goals and fitness levels, which is something I liked. There are a no. of cons as well -: Battery couldn't last you a whole day if you're a moderate user who uses about 6-7 hours from morning to evening, but at the same time the support for fast charging can save you, it offers 50% from 5-10% in just about 30-40 minutes, which would then last the phone for another 2-3 hours of moderate usage. Mind my words, when I say moderate I mean the usage of many apps back and forth and also includes the usage of video playing on Youtube, Content streaming on Instagram, etc and ... All in All if you're a normal user who spends about 6-7 hours upon phone per day, this phone will live up to the whole day.",5

55,Susmita Boral,Worth every penny,Such a good phone with beautiful display with sleek design . Being a throughout Samsung S series users this phone has a minimalist design with large screen and very thin bezels . The Iris Scanner really works very well and its a very new inclusion in the segment with an inbuilt AI Bixby really loved the phone and its burgundy red colour adds an extra elegance to this flagship the best android with a cheaper rate currently in the market to use with. The Exynos is lil bit faster than its counterpart Snapdragon 835 . The camera has all the quality of a basic dslr camera the photos are way too sharper than any phone in this segment eith a pocket pinch of only 38k,5

58,Biren Subba,Excellent,Awesome phone,5
59,Wamiq Hussain,Terrific purchase,"S8 is a good buy even in 2018 considering updates in S9 and S9+ are very elemental. S8 is also all set to receive Android 9.0 Pie Update with S9. It is the most beautiful looking piece of glass out there since 2017. Both the front facing and rear facing cameras are great too. If you get a deal for S8 under 40k, I think you should go for it. Department-wise review is as under.

Build / Design - On point 10/10 with IP68, USB Type-C, Clicky Build and solid build

Camera - 8.5/10 (for video), 9.5/10 (for pictures) - autofocus do suffer at Full HD 1080p at 60 fps, video stabilization is elite-class and microphone is loud and clear. Portrait mode from rear canera is gold in smartphone segment. Lowlight noise. Dynamic Range is also good especially from rear camera.

Performance - 9/10 - The Exynos chipset in S8 is better than Qualcomm SDM 835 but weaker than SDM 845 (used in 2018 flagship phones or Apple iPhones XS, XS Max and XR which use even faster A12 Bionic Chip). Performance is I should say flawless, gaming has high frame rates, but you can not record 4K videos (2160p) at 60fps, however you can record 4K at 30fps but stabilization isn't great.

Battery - 8/10 - The battery is slightly weaker, generally would end up by day. The compensation for this is fast charging. S8 charges really fast, but you need Adaptive Fast Charger (included in the box). Powerbanks won't help in Adaptive Fast Charging. I believe that battery life is satisfactory for a heavy user and more than expectation for a moderate user like me.

Extras - 10/10 - The S8 has wireless charging (charger dock not included in box), Iris Scanner (which I found useful), Fingerprint reader (although its position is a little uncomfortable), NFC and Samsung Pay, which is compatible with Indian POS machines, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, great in-box headphones tuned by AKG (a $100 value), heart rate sensor, Samsung Knox Security, Gyro, Baro, Magneto and Accelerometer, the sensors and extendibles provided here are best in industry as for 2018 standards. S8 has a hybrid SIM2 which can be used as a microSD card slot.

I RECOMMEND TO BUY S8 IF S9 IS $200 MORE EXPENSIVE THAN S8 AT YOUR RETAILER. I WOULD RECOMMEND S8 OVER PIXEL 2 XL/2, ONEPLUS 5, 5T OR EVEN 6. GOOD SERVICE BY FLIPKART.",5
60,Flipkart Customer,Good choice,"Great phone, one of the best in class camera. Pretty good battery life. TouchWiz has improved immensely and has a really nice feel to it.
The major qualm I have is the Bixby button. It's just physical bloatware, which is worse than the bloatware inside. If Samsung would have allowed us to remap the button to our choice, then that will be a game changer. Better than the new Pixel 2 or U11's squeeze function.
Bixby is still very new so it'll probably get better over time with software updates but until then it's nowhere near compared to Google Assistant or Apple's Siri.
The Camera is fantastic, great low light ability as well. The selective focus mode is decent but not excellent and has some way to go. Other modes such as pro or food are nice addition.
The speakers are good and loud although they sound a little tinny on high volume. And then there's the headphone jack. One of the major reason why I purchased the phone. Out of the box, it comes with AKG tuned earphones which are decent but if you love your sound, you're better off with earphones from Sennheiser or Sony.
Decent battery life with some really quick fast charging. With average to above average use and it still lasted me the whole day.
Fingerprint reader is not the fastest of the bunch but still not bad. Iris and face scanning are almost gimmicks but still work really well.
All in all a great flagship phone for people who prefer to use the phone in a single hand and who don't need a stylus.
Also it comes with the headphone jack!",4
61,Manish Vishwakarma,Perfect product!,"It was a great experience unboxing such a amazing gadget. iris recognition, finger print senser and camera is awesome. Infinite display provides it another achievement over other hi-fi smartphones.",5
62,Asutosh Gupta,Wonderful,This phone is awesome to use. Display is great and the smaller s8 is easier to use with one hand feels small and light. Made my iphone 7 plus look old. I am switching from iOS. Flipkart delivery service is super fast. Trust me you won't regret buying this phone.,5
63,Swapnil Amritkar,Great product,"I got it @29999 in big billion sale. Everything is original and was well packaged. The product is also fresh (September Packaging) not like sitting on the shelf for long time and the seller wanted to get rid off. It's ok that's a year old launch.
-Still @30k you get a best display in a smartphone.
-A good camera.
-Upto date design.
-Headphone Jack and with Bundled AKG Tuned Samsung Headphones.
-Fast Wired/Wireless Charging.
-Battery Goes a day for me with basic YouTube and 2 hours of online music streaming on high performance mode.
-Expandable Storage.
-The Speaker is good enough. Earpiece sounds good too.
- Doesn't heat a little bit much with my usage type.
-Awesome Build Quality.
-Water Resistant IP 68 Certification. Didn't try though. But it's good to have if it's raining and you get an emergency call, you can answer it.
-Some unique features like Image to Text, Ovel/rectangle type Screenshots.
-Overall awesome experience under 30K.

Who ever is complaining about Bixby I dont know why but I m using it and it is working very nice. Just command her anything and she will do it for u.
Big big plus is camera both front and back you can use selective focus to create bokhe effect so yes I am very happy with camera performance and in low lighting camera performance is just amazing

Its fast and the camera is amazing. We get so much detail in every picture. The phone looks classy and 5.8 inch is perfect size for normal /small hands. It's not at all bulky. The only issue is, the tempered glass curved screen protector is hard to find. And the phone feels slippery in hands so a case is recommended.",5

97,Pooja Hallen,Just wow!,We are galaxy s8 family... LoL.... Lovin it!!! :),5
98,niranjan Yadav,Worthless,"About the device :phone looks amazing so as the display, but the speed is slow in switching applications compared to one plus 6, battery back up issue can be resolved by inbuilt battery saver app and it can give a day battery life with moderate uses. Packed with fast charger (not as fast as one plus 6/3), headphone (nothing spapcial but looks durable) etc. About the flipkart: the reason behind one star rating is becouse of flipkart return policy which is really horrible, the phones hangs a lot only while recieving and calling someone, I made the complain twice to fk, they sent theri jeeves executive both of the time they accepted the issue taken vedios of the same, but after going out to their centre, they say there is no issue in the device, it has almost a month complaining continuously about the issue, and resolution is that the fk executive told me to get this complain written from Samsung after that only they can do the replacement. This is not reason for what we purchase the device from fk not from outside market, but now fk is cheating the consumers in this new way.",1

104,Asit Baran Behera,Best in the market!,"Just 5 stars...c'mon the phone needs more.Its been more than a month now since I am using this as my primary phone.One of the best phones you can get your hands on.Awesome camera.Proceesor speed is one of the best.Samsung has literally creamed of the bloatware and their own version of android,this time for the better.Really gives the stock andoid feel with the samsung flair.The most important and the best, the display.Its way generations ahead.Hope this would revolutionize the world of phones.The only con is the battery backup.It comes up a complete 1 day with more than 1 hr gaming and complete 4g data on.But I dont mind it coz the charger charges it double quick.

That's my personal and honest opinion after having and still using Moto Z Play and iPhone 6.",5
105,Danu DSD,Good quality product,"Awesome phone-wish the battery life could be better. I won't mention the specification as you already know it. Best thing about this phone is that every thing is customizable on it. There's a lot you can explore and twik. The only drawbacks are- 1. Battery life, compromise on few features to get decent battery life. 2. Tampered glass not staying on the screen, even without a back cover. As it has a unique edged screen, don't expect much from any tempered glass u try on it. Still try and you may get lucky. Overall, a superb phone that I waited to buy when deal was on and got it for 38k :) It was worth the wait as it saved money and I got Oreo already on it. Photos clicked with Moto G5S plus.",4
106,Flipkart Customer,Moderate,Bought 2 Samsung Galaxy S8 on Flipkart Big Billion days sale only @29999. The phones are good and at this price range really awesome. Fully satisfied with the fast delivery by Flipkart. But giving 2 stars because of Flipkart’s unprofessional behaviour. I bought both the phones with no cost emi option. However bank started charging interest on no cost emi and they told me that one phone is on no cost emi and the other one is on standard emi. And when I contacted Flipkart the customer representative firmly refused to help me and said nothing can be done now as they cannot change the payment option. This type of unprofessionalism can’t be expected from the e commerce giant Flipkart.,2
107,Flipkart Customer,Worth the money,"I took the phone at a flipkart price of rs.37000 about half an year ago.... The phone is amazing;; (PERFOMANCE) wise,it's an excellent phone-The game launcher is very useful while gaming-""no alerts during game"" is there#no disturbance of FB,Whatsapp notification poping up every time. There isn't much of a hang problem.I can easily switch from app to app with ease.;;; (CAMERA)Clarity is super but when zoom in,clarity reduces a lot.The Pro mode is very Useful to adjust lighting,ISO Etc.Slow motion is cool and Super Slow motion effect is added in a new Update.Camera can be used under water. (DISPLAY) is kinda sexy with its curvy shape.Watching movies,videos etc feel like next level with full display-however the phone is vulnerable to crack its display when fell down-so be careful-Original Display costs about 14000rs;;;;. (BATTERY)-This is what S8's minus is about.It's battery perfomance is poor especially when using Mobile Data.I get about 6-7hours or less when mobile data is used.Wifi usage doesn't consume this much battery.There are battery saver mode in S8 but it ain't enough.Watching movies,gaming doesn't consume much charge.Movie worth 2 hours consume less than 10-15% charge as per my opinion. I need to charge Twice per day because of continuous use-Whatsapp,FB,Tiktok,Insta,Camera.Power bank is a must for this phone...;;; Overall I love this phone,It has everything which I need except for battery.......I upgrade to S8 from Samsung Galaxy S3,so my view is as per that.",4
108,Flipkart Customer,Simply awesome,got at Rs-30k..every things working good design & performance just awesome,5
109,Bhavsagar Chaudhary,Hated it!,DON'T PURCHASE THIS MOBILE PHONE. I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and I received a defective piece. Defect was there was Led Notification light bleeding between the metal body and the main screen attached. Requested for a replacement and it's done .then again the replacement i received was also a faulty / defective piece of samaung s8 phone. In this model there is also light bleeding from every corner of led display and from the ear speaker. search about it on the internet and it's a defect in samsung phones . I also compared it with my friends mobile which he bought last year. This is the reason they are selling all refurbished/ defective handsets at this cheap price. Don't buy please,1
110,C%20G%20 Muthana,Very Good,Great product. The offers are challenging. Be careful to follow the complicated offer conditions diligently. One small deviation and samsung will deny fulfilling their offer saying condition not met!,3
111,Omkar Dandawate,Terrific,"This phone is already from future , infinity display makes it stand out from the rest . Crazy quick dual pixel autofocus makes it point and shoot master...ignore dxomark rating ,this camera is the best smartphone camera you can find right now , the pro mode is absolutely fantastic and lets you take dslr level low light shots with almost no grains ....there is a little problem with the aluminium frame heating up but thats natural. The earphones tuned by AKG are brilliant. Wireless charging is not that fast but wired charging is very fast and last for a day with 15-20% left at the end of the day . IP68 water and dust resistance makes it even more durable and you can easily take your fone for a dive.
Wraping everything up , the S8 is the best smartphone right now in the market.",5

114,Sujith,Average for this price.,"Phone has heating problem. i know its Android's issue. but still disappointed for a branded phone.

117,Pratyush Rana,Decent product,"i have been using S8 for 10 months now. The display and camera are the best features about the phone. The processor is average as it does get slow sometimes. The major issue is the battery of the phone. After using it for 10 months now, the battery lasts for only 6 hours.",3
118,Meban Nongrum,Super!,"for 30k it's the best phone you could get. Looks has aged well and performance is still top notch, battery though has been deteorating since the oreo update, other than that a really great buy beats any mid range phones under the same price category",5

120,Gourab Sadhukhan,Wonderful,it can easily satisfy your hunger of tech in 2019,5
121,Gnana Sree,Very poor,camera quality is good and performance worst it is taking toomuch time to open any app like other java mobiles. Edge screen is super and ultimate. But be careful before handling this phone it can easily slip from our hand. Performance wise it is too slow and i tried to return the phone because of its poor performance and the flipkart executive came and he simply rebooted the phone and said everything is good but still it is like that only.i am very much disappointed with this kind of service by flipkart. Any mobile comes with offer 30 to 40 % discount on bigbillion days or some other offers dont buy. If u buy u will get these type of mobiles only. And battery draining is very fast and super fast charging. I am not good at all with this overall performance of this phone.Hanging issues are more with in one week of phrchase of this mobile i got to know.,1

129,bhupendra verma,Classy product,"Absolutely one of the finest mobile by samsung after S9 and Note 9. superbb engineering and well developed by the samsung. curved display or infinity display is Love, its the beauty of the phone, crystal clear display with shap details undoubtedly makes it the best in class and you can change the resolution as per your need. Screen size is more than you need but mobile size is compatible as almost 90 per cent of the front is the display of the mobile and thats the gorgeousness of it. I am loving this phone as it has everything that I need. Everything is perfect and it feels like using a intelligent mobile rather than just being a smart phone. Camera, Display, Perfomance, Sound output, everything is perfect and works very well. the only thing I consider that can be improved is the battery capacity as it has 3000mah which feels not enough for this huge display. although battery lasts for the whole day but it could be improved and should have at least equal to S7 Edge that is 3600mah. Fast charger is very helpful and you are never out of battery. The bottom line from my side is that once you start using this phone no other phone would make you feel to replace this one. Its an incredibly amazing device. I Would give it 10 out of 10.",5

Thanks for reading.",5
151,Flipkart Customer,Brilliant,"super mobile, awesome display, amazing camera, battery is ok and handy. Burgundy colour looks superb",5
152,Priyanku Baruah,Mind-blowing purchase,"First and foremost lets just be done with the downside and say that a few glitches are there which might bug you a little given the money you've spent on it. As a flagship even a single lag or frame drop might give you panic attack. Having said that the Samsung Galaxy S8 is an incredible phone. Its well polished both harware and software wise. Lets just sum it up in few points - 1. Camera - Excellent. Won't need to carry your DSLR for most situations. Low light is very well handled. 2. Flagship build quality in every aspect. 3. Water and Dust resistant. 4. Bixby, although far behind Google assistant is fun to use. 5. All the Experience UI goodness without compromising on performance. Its almost as fast as latest flagships in day to day use. 6. The best display hands down. 7. Looks a million bucks. Just for the sceptics, few points to nit pick - 1. No portrait mode inbuilt. 2. Battery is bit weak. 3. Single speaker. 4. Will burn a small hole in your pocket. 5. A minor lag or frame drop (2-3 per day) here and there. P.S. I'm a heavy online media user and social media animal with minimal gaming. Heavy gaming might affect performance. Have scored 179000 approx. in Antutu with the device.",5
153,Sachin Gokhale,Mind-blowing purchase,"The product was perfectly packed and in best of the condition. It has manufacturing date of May 2018 and I bought the phone in June 2018, so that was neat. I got a nice exchange value(2400) for my old phone Galaxy A3(2015). The device itself is divine, just amazing. It's relatively small on the size which is exactly what I was looking for.

Thank you flipkart and the seller for the quick delivery.

Edit:13/05/2019.
Its been 11 months, the phone is still mind blowing. No issues at all. Still worth buying.",5
154,Ashish Kulkarni,Awesome,As reviewed by users here the phone is very good with all the qualities mentioned in pros section as per price of S8 is considered.S9 is definitely better with some upgrades on the cons section of S8 but is expensive than S8 right now.,5

Stunning Screen - far better than iPhone 7 / 8 and Galaxy S7 edge.

167,Satya Mishra,Super!,"Never reviewed a phone although I have bought around 20 mobiles including Nexus series (everything except Apple) in 12 years. But couldn't stop myself from writing about Samsung S8. I am using this one as my primary driver since May 3. Waited till the wireless charger arrived as that would have been the only bummer in my purchase. Now that I got the charger which works like a charm, I decided to write something about my experience with this ultimate Samsung marvel which I think can only be replicated by Samsung only.
This phone:
Is a visual delight and a beauty to hold.

Has worked fine till now(I don't play games on my S8) without a single glitch.

Has a camera which produces photos unmatched with any phone I had( I also have the S7 Edge).

Has finger print scanner (once you get used to it) and Iris scanner(Blazing fast even in theatre dark) which are 99% accurate along with face recognition.

Has infinity display(don't have words to describe it's beauty). Just watch any HD movies on this and you get hooked to screen. I watched the entire India Pak match on S8.

Has a new Experience UI which is much much much better than the TouchWhiz. The hidden tips and tricks videos on You Tube helps you unravel umpteen features in this ultimate phone.

The only drawback as per me is its battery life. Battery life on S8 is not that good for power users. The screen on time is around 3 and half hours with 4g network. But for that Samsung has provided fast charger which is very handy and charges the phone very quickly.

I am glad I purchased this as I wondered after S7 Edge how can Samsung entice me to buy it's next flagship. It did.Kudos Samsung👍👍👍💖",5
168,Sridhar Ponnuri,Did not meet expectations,"Device is getting over heat when charging as well as on mobile network...unable to use..battery drains quickly..not happy with the mobile...guys I m not recommending to buy this...requested flipkart for money back...Will c what will happen..
One star is for display...",1
169,Joel Eliphaz,Good quality product,"Feature rich for sure. I was using an iPhone 7 before this and this phone certainly kills it with respect to features and display. Camera is damn good, barring the stability, in comparison with the 7. One key thing I miss is the smoothness of moving through apps and the fingerprint sensor. The face recognition isn't the best, but decent. Sound is great. Really nice recording quality, both video and audio. Definitely value for money, I got it for 31,000 INR. I preferred this over the OnePlus because of the width. I'd actually give it a decent 3.5/ 5 instead of 4.",4
170,Yash Verma Makeovers,Perfect product!,Worth in 2019. Perfect smartphone & beautiful too 💎,5
171,KAMAL KRISHNAN,Not worth the money,"I bought this product and I have been cursing me ever since I bought this product. The only releif for me is that I paid only 27k. The phone over heats almost all the time, The charge is not staying for even 6 hours and it is getting stuck almost all the time. I have no idea how this ends up being flagship product of Samsung. Overall I agree that the device is feature rich but whats the use if your mobile has to be always wired and kept in a freezer.",1
172,Kulbir Singh,Mind-blowing purchase,Undoubtedly one of the best phones I have used recently. I was already using a S8 but unfortunately the display broke after I dropped it. Must say that was dissapointing. One drop and the display couldn't take it. Ordered the same phone again as couldn't resist it's beauty but this time the lesson is to use with all protective gears.,5
173,Devendra Dodiya,Just wow!,world best mobile Samsung Galaxy S8,5
174,Avijit Hazra,Does the job,"Unexpected from Samsung, poor battery and heating issue, It would make you happy just for her killer look, very disappointed with battery performance seems like I have to carry charger everywhere 100% > 0% within 3-4 hours if you use wifi/mobile data frequently.",3
175,ajay shukla,Nice product,"1.Look wise it stole my heart, performance wise I expected bit more from it. 2.Screen is another factor which create smart option to be adaptative to any whether condition,it adjusts well 3.camera lacks in low lightning condition but outdoor it lets every details visible.. 4.inbuilt speaker is also Good mids and high are well equipped along with crisp vocals. 5.Battery drain is minimal due to less applications, in this regard Will update it here 6.Exynos performance Does perform well in terms of daily usage, Don't know how it work with games. I played few of then neither lagging nor heating. 7.Bixby I call it every time and it ease situations Cons Back Glass panel, Ram Management, Steel Back panel could be best Option",4

183,Karthik Kumar,Awesome Phone,"Never expected such a slim beauty from Samsung. Phone was very slim and awesome. You won't regret your decision and go for it.

Thanks to Flipkart for delivering the product much before the promised date. I got mine of 1st April. And also for the the goodies came across with my mobile (Greeting Card and Note Book)

Those complaining on Wireless charger, it was not the issue from Flipkart. This is the way the offer is framed by Samsung, so you should check all the terms and conditions before buying high end phones instead of blaming FK.",5
184,Ravi N P,Excellent Phone....,"Awsome Display, Good Camera.... very good phone",5
185,Shivaprasad,How to get Free Wireless harger,"Pros- Looks (infinity Display is great), Iris Scanner (I liked the way how the phone unlocks when I just look at it albeit from a straight angle), Camera- Very nice camera from samsung to date. I have not used Pixek XL but this camera is not bad anyway.

Now for those of you worried on how to get wireless charger
1) The conditions for the charger has been changed. You are no longer required to activate Samsung Pay.
2) Download/Update My Galaxy app.
3) Register with Phone number/Email ID used while ordering the phone
4) Wait for 2 days
5) Open the my galaxy app in that open the tab Coupons at the bottom of the screen. You will find inside the free coupon code and instructions to redeem. Follow it and you will get your wireless charger.",5
186,saurabh khairnar,Amazing!!!!,"What an experience Unboxing the #SamsungGalaxyS8. A wonderful packing from flipkart, timely delivery, an audio greeting welcoming you to the world of Infinity Display. It feels great having the Beast. If looks could really kill, YEAH!!!!! this is the phone that could do it. Awesome design, sleek, slim and beautiful. If you want to have a feeling of love at first sight, I'd say go for S8.

Kudos to Samsung for building such an amazing device. Loved it.

Really, as the greeting from flipkart says, 'settling for the best' is a wonderful feeling.

#GoForIt :) #HatsOffSamsung _|..|",5
187,Imran Shaik,Excellent,"No one can match samsung S series...they were awesome earlier and they are beyond the expectations now with s8....amazing device

As a samsung lover I am 98% satisfied with s8

2% is they could have bumped up the batttery capacity",5
188,Suvendu Swain,Will never receive the Free Wireless charger.,Better wait and go for iPhone. I have got this mobile pre-booked the device on 20th May and got it on 2nd April but still now fighting with Samsung to get my wireless charger. But I have lost faith on Samsung and hence 1*. No complains on the phone but I will never buy a Samsung phone again.,1
189,Flipkart Customer,Pretty good,"Let me state it at the onset...The S8 is a gorgeous device in an increasingly stale (look and form factor wise) smartphone market bound to turn heads,draw 2nd glances and invite questions. But I had a bad experience within 2 weeks of purchase when all of the phone's sensors stopped working. Flipkart refused to replace. Had to approach the service center. They took 4 days to fix during which they replaced the motherboard. Has been running fine since then(fingers crossed), been around 3 months. Would have rated it a full 5 but for the bad experience at the onset. It's a great device, great look and feel, beautiful color, good battery, amazing screen but only about average software experience(in comparison to stock android or even oneplus or moto iterations), with occasional slight stuttering but has no other major issues . With S9 around the block, prices will go further down and will make it a better proposition and great value for money.",4
190,Aman Gour,Highly recommended,Good phone,5
191,Gagandeep Singh,Phone awesome but Flipkart pathetic service,"The phone is beautful from both inside and outside. However, Flipkart straight away sidelined it self from the pre-booking offer of free samsung charger. No coupon code recieved if booking through Flipkart. Better to buy from Samsung directly.",1
192,Saikat Kar,Wonderful,"The first time I took it out of the box, I knew instantly that it is nothing like I had ever seen before. The look amd feel of the device is just simply beyond words. I would advise everyone to go for the black variant as it blends seamlessly with the curved AMOLED display. Cameras are the best in the market and the display is better than anything else that is available in the market. The only downside is that the experience is not as fluid as it should be. The fingerprint scanner isn't that bad to be honest, but the battery life is below par. Flipkart delivered it within 22 hours so no complains there. Also my unit does not have any red tint issues fortunately.",5
193,Subhobrata Sengupta,Awesome phone !,"Don't really need to rate and review the best smartphone in the world. It is simply awesome. Fast, smooth, gorgeous and very different from the thousands of phones in the market. Flipkart also sent the phone on Day One of its launch, in an awesome gift box, with a fabulous planner diary bound in faux leather and an offer for a free wireless charger :-)",5
194,Mansuri Zahir,Excellent,"Its very amazing phone
Now samsung has the stuff against apple series. I have all phones from 4s to 7. But S8 is superb phone with all festures in dual sim 4 gb Ram camera excellent infinity display id gt8 view.
I recommand it to all in cost effective prize only with Flipkart.
Dr Zahir Mansuri.",5
195,Srinath Nair,Very poor,"Absolutely and utterly disappointed. When you pre order and pay 60k for a mobile phone as classy and beautiful as this, you also expected Samsung to deliver on its big promises. The One star rating is only for Flipkart on its delivery and the mobile phone. Samsung on its end has disappointed me beyond extent. Booked the phone on 20th April with the free wireless charger offer. Uptil now, due to a technical issue on their end, I am yet to receive my free wireless charger. If I'm paying 60k, I expect everything to be delivered. Even the promises. And Samsung has fallen way short of my expectations. It's been One and a half months now and all Samsung is doing is making me chase my own tail. They acknowledge their mistake, yet have not resolved the problem despite me providing all documents that they asked for. Rubbish. Samsung, you let me down. Totally. As a middle class guy buying his mother her first beautiful smart phone, I expected more from you on the promises you made as a company.
Regarding the phone, it is beautiful. I've never seen my mother so happy. But as to the promises by Samsung, don't expect them to keep it. At all.",1
196,Anil Farkade,Fabulous!,"Best Smartphone I have ever used. Looks stunning, Battery is also very good, normally gives 48 hrs in one charge. Camera is the best in market, both front and rear. The only problem is there should have been dedicated micro SD card slot. Otherwise the phone is best in Market. I have also got coupon code for Wireless Charger, a bit late but got it after follow up with Samsung, placed order n will soon get it.",5
197,MANIK SINGLA,Horrible,"very poor battery, drains in half day time.. don't buy this phone.. desire the best ever screen and camera",1

199,Rohit Mishra,Nice product,"Product delivered before time so happy from service.
The product quality is amazing it gives you the luxury and premium feel without any doubt.
Its been 2 days using this phone and seriously i found no cons about this phone.
Peolpe talk about its wrong placement of fingerprint scanner but trust me its not an issue after few days of usage.",4
200,yash gurudatta,Not good,"Pros-
good infinity Screen
Wonderful Camera Quality
Iris Feature

Everything else would be good because you have paid a bomb to Samsung EXCEPT

Cons-

Wireless Charger was a Marketing gimmick Because of there superb T&C of Samsung Very few people will qualify for the free wireless charger as there are many difficulties like it is not accepting my Dr card & saying to add other card( i tried two cards).

Very bad sound quality while you hear songs on earphone(I phone 4s is thousand times better than this).

Back side Finger sensor.",2
201,Karthik Raju,Brilliant,"I am giving this review after using this device almost for 20 days as I have prebooked it. About beautyand performance, its exceptional there is no doubt in that and is the main source of attraction at any place. Experience UI looks very light and classy in comparison to the Samsung's earlier heavy Touchwiz. Battery backup is good. As i have noticed, 70% of charge lasts for entire day with 4G LTE and Location ON for messaging, browsing and with some VoLTE calls. Iris scanner response is incredible. Camera shots and videos mainly in low light is remarkable due to its bigger aperture. Touch response is amazing but gets degraded if Tempered Glass is used as it introduces some gap between the glass and the screen therefore, I removed it in the very 1st day. Now coming to Wireless charger, lookwise its good but it charges very slowly in comparison to wired one.
Overall, as of now I have not come across any disappointing feature in S8. It gives a good value for money.",5
202,Flipkart Customer,Waste of money!,Battery doesn't last even for a day. It's a new phone.,1
203,Flipkart Customer,Brilliant,"Product looks too amazing. Low light photography superb even at pitch black condition. Played asphalt 8 without any lag and experienced joy through great graphics. Associated head phone is of great quality than previous galaxy head phones. Two SIM slots one nano and the other slot can be used for wither micro SIM OR SD card. Edge display is top notch and attractive. Samsung pay app makes all heads turn in super markets. Felt like a celebrity. Go for it without second thought. Iris scanner, face recognition too.will again write back after some days of usage",5
204,Penchal Reddy,Terrible product,"NEED TO CARRY A POWER GENERATOR ALONG INSTEAD OF POWER BANK AND MOBILE CHARGER WITH ME..

CHARGING TIME AND DISCHARGING TIME BOTH ARE ALMOST EQUAL.",1
205,Flipkart Customer,Terrific purchase,So far so good as this is flasghip of Samsung still value for money to buy it in 2018....,5
206,Ramniwas Kumawat,Utterly Disappointed,"BATTERY consumption of samsung s8 is very high it dicharge the phone very fast though i switch of my 4G network also. I use moblie for only calling. i charge it 100 percent daily when i come back from office its battery seems only 5 to 10 percent . I am not satisfied with this product. Everthing in S8 is good but it consume more battery power. Before S8 i have Samsung galaxy J7(2016) the phone is really fantastic. And its battery is also good It don't consume so much battery. And i switch on my 4G network all the time in my phone (J7) . So, from my side i only give 1 rating to samsung S8 . In my opinion it's not good of you☹ I am so sad that i spent so much money on buying S8 but i don't seem it good.",1
207,Kapila Mahanama,Highly recommended,"I'm switching to samsung from Apple and this is my number one choice . can't beat the feeling. why I hate Apple now is because they're bloody inconsiderate of the customer base. no dual SIM, easily outdates equipmnts because of software, so may restrictions, minimum customization in interface, poor battery performance, nothing new on tech side updated phones, I can keep going on but will stop by saying SAMSUNG S8 is a better choice on any day. in your face Apple!",5
208,HUKAM SINGH RATHORE,Just wow!,Best mobail phone on last all lunches Samsung,5
209,Adarsh M V,Unsatisfactory,Phone came with a smudge mark on screen. Oleophobic protection coat is peeled i think.. never thought id get a damaged prodect under pre book,1
210,Rahul Kasireddy,Must buy!,Fully satisfied with product (best display have ever seen in a phone) as well as flipkart for once as the phone was delivered well before...thanx for that. Update: Received 2 codes... one code for tumi case (received on 9 may) and the other for wireless charger today.,5
211,Flipkart Customer,Simply awesome,Phone is absolute amazing but please don't get trapped into buying the default VR. It is not compatible with s8. It is only compatible upto s7 series. They are liars saying it is frequently bought along with the phone. I don't know if I'll be getting my refund or not.,5
212,Partha Ghosh,Worthless,"Paying the EMI, using the phone someone else..",1
213,Flipkart Customer,Very poor,"The device is a batteey drainer. The piece i have bought losses battery by the minute even when power saving mode is on, display optimized and background apps killed.

216,Manish Meena,Wonderful,all is good on mobile,5
217,Flipkart Customer,Did not meet expectations,worst phone,1
218,vikash kumar,Very poor,worst phone ever. very fragile screen even a small fall or a small hit and screen will crack. In my case it was just keeping it on glass table. On top of it there is no screen protector in market which fits it correctly since it has curved glass. Cant believe an expensive phone like this can have such a fragile screen. Also the length by weight dimension is also one of the turn off.,1
219,Ravi Garg,Did not meet expectations,"Purchased it 7 months ago. And yesterday night suddenly device goes shot dead. Tried every possible thing to revive but it didn't even blinked for a while. Visited customer care executive says motherboard has to be replaced its a electronic device & such things are common. I asked him to replace the device as such major repairs within warranty period is unacceptable. But he denied to do so.
Took Samsung device after 5 years wondering what happened overnight using flagship device is a threat these days & coming all this from such prominent & well know brand is demoralizing. If this happens again in next 6 months that means it was a gift from me of 50 grands to Samsung.",1

Other than the heating issue there's no problem. excellent product.
Dope camera,
display,
performance,
and everything.
now battery...
everyone who's complaining about the battery,, well don't expect much from 3000 mAh battery when you have a freaking QuadHd display.
Worth every dime. woohoo, cheers!!",4
225,Vignesh Sivanandam,Super!,"Great buy. The phone is great value for money. Better than one plus 6 in terms of design, display, camera and audio clarity with earphone. One plus 6 is better on all other parameters but costlier too. Only problem is that I'm struggling to find the right tempered glass for the screen as it has curved sides. Already tried a couple of them. The sensitivity of the touch gets reduced. Otherwise can't complain about anything.",5
226,Arshdeep Singh,Just wow!,"This phone is all about brand value, I'll tell you everything about this device. so first positive things:-
1.the display is the best thing of this device of you love streaming and watch movies this is the best device
2. camera is also TH-E best thing of this device, the low light photo are also good.
3. this phone will never let you down among 2-3 people,
this phone is the centre of attraction.
Now all the negative points:-
1. Battery is the major disaster in this mobile this phone doesn't last for day with always on screen display , though it has fast charging it take 1:30 min. to full charge
2. mobile get heated when you play games like pubg or Fortnite
3. please don't thing that it is good in gaming it couldn't run pubg in hdr and in hd also the quality is poor. there are many devices that are below 30000 and run pubg better than s8
so please thing again before taking this device, but if you want brand value or best display quality or center of attraction among your friends and colleagues and you don't do any professional things in mobile like rendering video or heavy gaming. then this mobile is the best device",5
227,macniell dsouza,Fair,"pross. a good product camera is better than iPhone. the screen is amazing makes things pleasant.so you get a great feeling . the handset is very elegant in appeal. The problem is being the galaxy 8 has less features than the galaxy 5 . the infrared sensor , the motion sensors are missing which really dissapointed me. the battery charges fast but also comes down more faster . other than that all is going smooth. thanks",3
228,Flipkart Customer,Pretty good,"This phone is top class.. Display is super amazing, performance is very good. As a premium phone it has it all but only concern is the battery. If you are a heavy usage user it's no good, 3000mah battery will not be enough for you because the quality of this phone is way high and so is the batter usage. For a heavy usage user it will last for about 6-7 hours max, for light and moderate usage it can last upto 10-12 hours. Other downside of this phone is the camera, It's just above average when you compare it with recently launched phones but, if you are okay with these two then the phone is amazingly good with awesome built quality and super amazing performance.",4

359,Jayakumar,Awesome,"Got this phone during 2018 BBD for 28k. My previous phone was samsung j7 purchased during 2015 BBD and I used it everyday till I got this one.Big thanks to flipkart.

1. Screen resolution.Curved is good for swipping. Curved takes time getting used to.Anti fingerprint. Colours are brilliant. Infinity display is very good.

2.Cam : front and back are very good. Back cam has image stabilisation.

3.battery: Charges in 1hour 40 minutes on quick charge mode. Makes phone hot. Lasts 1day on normal usage. Heavy phone users may need external battery packs.

4. Body : glass front and back. Very thin. Gets very cold in AC and hot on too much usage or charging. Back body gets finger prints except camera cover.

5.software : same samsung experience software as in other samsung phones. Nothing special in s8 except an infinity theme.

6. Hardware : every small hardware piece speaks of quality. Like microphone or speaker.
Many sensors I dont use on everyday basis like heart rate sensor or retina sensor or samsung pay but just good to have.

7. Finger print sensor : lot of people said it's position is not good. I found no issues to me.

8. Phone heating : i feel Its because of full glass body that even small heating by cpu or battery get exaggerated. It gets more cold in AC room and more hot when using the phone intensively.

9.Genuineness : Phone is genuine piece. Make is sept 2018. It's made in India. My seller was trucomretail.

10. Earphones : samsung brand and akg tuned. Earphones are very good quality with good bass. Possibly worth around 4k. I have sony earphones worth 3k and sennheisers worth 5k and I found these earphones in this range.

11. Cases and covers: due to curved display I feel finding tempered glass or screenguard is difficult.my colleagues using s8 and s9 have been using without any screenguard and for now I am doing the same.

12 Value for money : I feel it is very much worth 28k. The quality of every component in this phone is premium. Engineering is very good. For the technology and quality , this price feels justified.",5

364,Poulomi Hore,Excellent product,"few things which could have been better:

1. Dual sim should have been there(now we have to be content with hybrid dual sim)
2. In built memory and ram should have been more( as in 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM)
3. The finger print sensor, iris sensor is slow and when a call is coming the screen shows the no much after the ring starts",5
365,Parth Vishnoi,Awesome,"One of the best Android based platform in the Market is S series phones of Samsung. S8 is handy. Looks are astonishing. Screen is outstanding. In love with S8. Battery is OK. Headphones inside box are pretty good. Just 1 suggestion: Screenguard or screen protector does not work well on edge phones. I tried many but none of them stayed but need not to worry as even with guard, screen is pretty tuff and does not get scratches easily.",5

473,Sonal Sarkar,Terrific,"Using this phone for a little for than one month now. Looks and feels very premium. The display is the biggest attraction, it is very sharp and its curved edges makes it bezel-less. The camera is amazing and love the selective focus feature. The phone is super fast and charge is comfortably lasting a full day. Apps like Samsung's stock browser, reminder etc. are good to use. I'm also a big fan of the always on display feature. In short loving everything about this phone.",5
474,sYeD,Excellent,"REVIEW FOR ""Samsung Galaxy S8""
so this is my first phone from india, i usually get it from overseas where my uncle lives because its a lot cheaper there..
so getting back to the phone..to sum it up in one sentence ""its intricately carved peice of art""

PROS:

1.6 HOURS OF SCREEN ON TIME(With Moderate to high usage)
2. ABSOLUTELY NO LAGS
3.GREAT GAMING EXPERIENCE
4.SCREEN IS JUST MESMERIZING
5.CHARGES IN 1 HOUR 40 MINS FULLY

CONS

1.SLIPPERY (COVER ABSOLUTELY NEEDED)
2. CAN'T TYPE PROPERLY AS THE HAND TOUCHES THE SCREEN SOMETIMES
3.BLOATWARE (I REALLY DON'T MIND IT)
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE

FOR COVER USE ""SPIGEN COVERS FROM AMAZON""",5

603,Sumit Joshi,Not recommended at all,Awesome phone and in love with it.,3
604,Chintan Shah,Worst experience ever!,"As usual, typical Flipkart nonsense. The only reason I used Flipkart was because this phone was available only on this website.
It said while placing the order that there is a free wireless charger being offered with the phone. Only when you look in detail at the terms and conditions does it say that the charger will be shipped 90 days after the placing of the order. This was pointed out to me only after I grilled their representative on the phone.

Flipkart seems to have made a habit of such things. Don't think I'll ever be using this website again.",1
605,ADITYA SINGH,Worthless,"doesnt perform like a flagship device.App loads slowly, battery drains very fast even in 2G network and in mid battery power saving mode. Only plus point is the camera. otherwise dont buy this phone instead go for OnePlus or iPhone.",1

with this u can think of switching from iphone to android
and its bundled with wonderful offers and gifts.
Samsung is offering a free wireless charger with this device and the process is a bit complex though i did everything as stated but no code for showing to samsung store and i have no idea how to get that free charger.
please suggest",5
608,Amudha Jagan,Expected a better product,"Previous device not at all good I exchanged one more device as of now it's ok I will see another 10 days
My previous device have many issues like
Wi-Fi not working
Hanging
Battery draining
Over heating device
Am unable to talk at least 30 mins
It's very bad expectation from Samsung",2
609,Hemanth Nirujogi,Bad battery and stuttery. (Seller denies returns),"Battery back up was really bad and unsatisfactory so, I placed a return request on the same day of delivery. Seller ( i.e, TrueComRetail ) has been denying to take the return request ( twice ). Flipkart can't even care to help with it. Very bad experience.

Try to avoid buying the product from bad sellers. Same offers and no cost emi plans are provided by official Samsung stores. It's highly recommended to purchase from them.

My thoughts:

You won't be disappointed with the S8 if it wasn't for the battery, which is the main asset of a high end smartphone.
^ Device is futuristic and feels fantastic in hand.
^ Software is clean and pleasing.
^ Camera is not PIXEL perfect but does the job.
^ Performance was stuttery and screen on time is very pathetic. No one expects this from a high end processor.
^ Display may be the most gorgeous one you've ever seen but to drive those many pixels, battery has to be good too. Samsung recommends to use the device in FHD mode and low brightness which, there's no point in doing that.

Go for the S8 plus if budget agrees.",2
610,Flipkart Customer,Classy product,"I received my phone on 30tg may , its been 4days with the phone n its just awsm! Just have few things to say ....(about wireless charger)
* I know ,finger print scanner has been placed in a weird position but I mostly used the iris scanner wic is way faster n smother than I expected !(works in total darkness too)
* On paper battery might seem small,but easily I was getting 4 hours of screen on time (again its screen on time not over all time ).
* And people complaining about wireless charger , pls be patient Caz I spoke to Samsung pay team n they said the promotional offer will soon be reflected in the Samsung pay app ! And guys its a promotional offer from samsung, the wireless charger offered is a nnew one to Indian market ,available only from 1st of may only. (Every promo offer from many other companies are also the same ,takes time so stop saying stuffs like Samsung cheated u n all ).",5
611,Khushal Kothari,Fabulous!,"Quick information for anyone who bought this phone in pre order and is still not sure how to get free wireless charger.

615,Nandu Thorkar,Must buy!,"Got it in 38k. So very good value for money. No doubt best looking phone. Camera hardware is one of the best but software is not so good. Use Google camera app and then this hardware does magic. Performance is good though nowhere close to pixel and oneplus devices. I didn't like the UI much. I wish I had an option of Stock android.

Now the screen, owww. It's THE best in the business.

618,anmol thakur,Excellent,"Well buddy if you have the budget, this is the best complete package you will ever get.
1. A beautiful,compact, large screen and thin mobile phone.
2. The best single hand operational phone presently in market.
3. After 3 months of usage, no problem of heating, lagging even after playing high configuration games.

4. Camera quality is best and if I may day it's better than iphone.

5. Battery appears to be of smaller capacity but will last you atleast 10 hours of listening to music along with chatting land calling.
OR
Least 8-9hrs of gamming.




Anything better would be a paper thin mobile phone or one with a virtual screen.



Cons.... Expensive flip cover and it has considerable weight....

The design is flawless and bio metrics are working good as well. To those people who are concerned about the Wireless charger missing, the offer was from Samsung and not Flipkart and in order to claim the same we need to do the following:

After pre-booking you have to purchase and activate the Device on or before 31st May 2017 with the same mobile number with which you did the pre-booking. Once you complete the activation you need to register on the My Galaxy App on or before 30th June 2017 with the same mobile number which has been used for pre-booking and activating the Device. After approximately 4 days of signing in /registering in to My Galaxy App, Customer will be able to view the offer banner on the Home Screen of My Galaxy App.Customer can generate the “Free Wireless Charger” coupon code from My Galaxy App by clicking on the offer banner.",5

625,Sagar Kumar,Amazing 'S'exy8,"Truly brilliant feat in mobile engineering and design. Impeccable blend of sleek attractive design and technology. Iris unlock is superfast. All those reviewers cribbing about the placement of the fingerprint sensor can be in awe of the iris scanner as this unlocks the phone without any glitch or delay. Speed and processing is blazing superfast. I have added a 64 gb external card to the phone which was there in my s7 edge and still the phone runs smoothly. absolutely delighted with the fast delivery by flipkart yesterday itself and more so because of the owning this beauty of a product from Samsung.

Better service should not be confined to motto, but at delivering ""It"". Hope to have better relationship ahead......",4
629,Kalpesh,Just wow!,"Great display. Awesome specs. Improved packaging from flipkart. Iris scanner works great however it didn't work properly in direct sunlight for me and also while in motion i.e walking.. Tried playing 4k video on YouTube app to get the experience of superior dispaly quality but app can play video up to 1080p only. Later on i was able to play 4k video with chrome app in desktop mode by changing resolution manually to 4k in youtube's setting. AKG headsets sounds really good. All required connectors such as type-c to micro usb and usb are included in package. They could have include Wireless charger as well in package but they didn't.

Activated Samsung pay account with same sim and email which I have used for pre-order. Activated my Galaxy account as well with same sim; yet free wireless charger offer was not visible under promotions in Samsung pay app as notified earlier. After contacting with samsung support they informed me that once i receive/collect and activate the Device i have to follow the process given hereunder to redeem the free Wireless Charger. The Process to redeem Free Wireless Charger is as under:
Fresh enrolment/sign in to the pre-loaded My Galaxy app must be completed by 30th June 2017 failing which the customer will not be eligible for the offer.
Registration & sign in to My Galaxy to be done with same mobile number used for pre-booking & activating the Product. In case any other mobile number is used, the customer will not be eligible to avail the offer.

630,Ramanan Murugesan,Absolute rubbish!,"Fantastic mobile,
But I didn't get a wireless charger,
They are cheating us with the T&C,
TOTALLY POOR EXPERIENCE with Flipkart's offers.",5
631,Pankaj Geetey,Expected a better product,"All specs good but the phone overall doesnt stand out that much. Although a better experience overall than a street phone but still i did not expect following
1. Speaker isnt loud enough.
2. Battery discharges faster.
3. Why samsung has given so many apps.
4.Microphone isnt very effective. Experiencing that other party often misses out what i said.
5. Samsung could have given a beautiful flip cover and bluetooth earphones. No standard flip covers available in market which match the looks and status of this phone.
I wish Samsung could do last mile better to make it a better experience for people spending so much.",2
632,Gupta Information Systems,Worst experience ever!,Device is constantly heating and taking 2:35 hh:min to charge. Flipkart says it's usual charging time.,1
633,Imran Pathan,Fabulous!,"This is just a Beauty, Great looks, the first reason to buy this phone.
About the performance I will give 4 ratings for a price tag, camera is great with decent low light performance. Battery is good to handle a day usage. Fast charge is great feature to add a plus point in this phone.
Don't be in a thought that back of this phone is scratch proof, as soon as you buy the phone get a back cover which suits the phone, there are very few back covers which suits this phone. I bought one from local market which gives a great look to this phone.
Headphone is also an advantage to have with this phone, great quality. Also you get few accessories like c type to normal android phone connector.
On an average 5 ratings is justified. I bought this at approx 48000 with cash backs and discounts on interest free emi.",5

And its bugging watching 70% of its same software technologies past years and iPhone X is one of the worst design . So I bought a Samsung s9plus as a side phone by keeping apples as my main phone, because it takes time to use Android and the s9 plus was so huge to fit in . Later exchanged to this Samsung s8 .

Trust me!! S8 is Best of all phones . Its making things so easy . But whatever I can give a proper review after 6 months only . Cause I still dont trust SAMSUNG.",5

660,Roshan Bennet,Worth every penny,"The below review is based on mild usage so it may be biased to a certain extent since I haven't run any graphic intensive games and stuff.
Camera - 8.5 /10, especially low light is damn good.
Sound clarity and loudness - 9/10, it's pretty loud.
Display - 10/10, absolutely stunning display.
Battery - 8.5/10, it easily manages for a day and half. (since I don't use my phone for games).
I got this phone at 25k during flipkart sale and probably this is the best one can find for this price.
P.S- I'm really impressed with the akg tuned earphones, the sound quality is amazing.
And I'm also suprised that they included a USB TO Type C connector and also a micro USB to TYPE C connector in the box.",5

699,chaitanya chitturi,The best and the stylish smartphone I ever seen,"everything is excellent and the only thing I observed it is rarely I mean just there is 0.5% chance to get hanged but the good thing even if it hangs all the home buttons and other buttons work fine it will work normally if we just close the app in which it got hanged. It will only get hang while using heavy apps only and even in 0.5% most of the times it will recover automatically in a second.

The style and shape of the device is pretty awesome once you started using it no other mobile will come in to your mind except galaxy s9 which is also having the same look and design.",5

World best design
Pros: gr8 performance
Infinity display is superb

1.poor battery goes 100 to 30% In just 2 hours even using wifi
2.battery heating issue..
3.Range issue (mi mobiles catches twice than samsung)
4)poor earphone sound",3
712,Jaikumar M,Great product,"Is it worth it? If you want the very best smartphone on the market, quicker, has waterproofing & a camera that's very nearly as good. It's better looking than Google's phone, too, has a microSD card slot so you can expand the storage, and there's more storage as standard as well. It's better than the iPhone 7, too, in almost every respect.

The good - The best-looking phone around crushes it in performance, battery life, water-resistance and wireless charging. An external storage slot lets you keep more photos, videos and music.

The bad - Its awkwardly placed fingerprint reader leads to camera smears and longer unlock times, which is aggravating when you use it to unlock your phone dozens of times a day.

The bottom line - The Samsung Galaxy S8's fast speeds and fantastic curved screen make it a top phone for 2017, but the annoying fingerprint reader could sour your experience.",5

723,Krishna Prasad,Pretty good,"Samsung products are good.
Though having 4 GB RAM, gets stuck when we make call, cut call and switch back to main menu.
Might be in the next update it will be fixed.
Battery backup is too low compare to J7 or A series.
Sound quality is Good, but could offer us Dual speaker for best Stereo effect.
Touch sense is too Good feels like a silk when u touch screen.
Many times stuck's when Unlocking phone by Biometric or Face recognition.
Themes can be improved for edge phones where we don't find in Samsung themes.
Camera not so impressive, but slomo is too good feature.
Creating Emo of our own is too good.
Need to update phone regularly for better performance.
Very Handy, fits in a Hand.
Bixbi is kool feature where you like to hangout with as Siri and Ok Google.
Durability is not so good than Apple7.
Fast charger charges it within an Hour.

945,Venkatesh,Really Nice,"I am writing this review after using it for 3 months. No doubt its an amazing phone but the most irritating part is the positioning of finger print sensor. Not only is it positioned beside camera but it is very difficult to reach. Another negative point is that the battery drains away too quickly, it hardly gets you through the day if you are more than a moderate user. But it might not affect you much as it has fast charging. Fast charging takes almost 1 hr 30 mins to refill battery (almost 1% a minute). Postive points.. Looks, display, performance, camera...",4

1013,Abheet Abheet,Classy product,first of all i would like to share my experience about S8 is that its amazing phone. S- series is always been top notch. But price is comparatively is on higher side but brand value is such that you have to pay for it. Decent phone with decent configurations. but not supporting 2 volte connection at the same time. This is a drawback of it. If one volte is running then other sim will automatically shift into 3G. Paying that much amount for such congratulations is really painful.,5

1092,Tuhina Gupta,Mind-blowing purchase,"Great phone to have in the price that flipkart offered during Republic day sale. Battery is a concern for even moderate users otherwise rest all boxes are ticked positively. Do get a cover/case and a screen guard for the phone. Though it has Gorilla 5 protection but its better to be safe. Case is required as the phone without the case is very sleek and slippery so have a safeguard. One small thing regarding the fingerprint sensor - The location of the sensor is just adjacent to the rear camera and one tends to miss. Since I have put on a case, perhaps because of that I need some 2 to 3 attempts to get my fingerprint scanned and its just not only for the positioning of the sensor. Face and iris scanner works perfectly though.",5

1180,pushpender C,Fabulous!,"Super product for a price of 28k (Big Billion Day sale), using it for 2-3 months now and is flawless. Exceptionally beautiful display.
I am iPhone user also (which is superior due to its simplicity & awesome camera). S8 Also has very very good camera esp. in low light it beats iPhone 6 hands down... there is no comparison. Works smooth but i am not a fan of Samsung UI... its a little confusing. Battery is just about ok... with moderate usage 9am to 7pm.. fast charging is not even closer to dash charging of One Plus phones (have used that also for a year).

Good Things :
1. Amazing looks (most certainly the MOST BEAUTIFUL phone ever produced)
2. Exceptional display
3. Low light pictures
4. Smooth performance

No so good things
1) Fast Charging
2. Battery
3. Outdoor camera (comparing with iPhone)
4. Portrait mode... not so great
5. Samsung UI Confusing
6. Accidental touches sometime due to edge to edge screen",5

As I am using this with Jio SIM, which means I am using the latest Rich Communication service which is enabled by default in this device . So I am able to send Chat/Rich Call/in Call SharedMap and Post call services. All of these I am using in the native message application only I AM NOT USING WHATSAPP since.

Still I have some basic problem in this phone , I guess Samsung must take care of this issue,

1.When people is speaking (loud speaker turned down), by keeping this device in front of them, other party is not able to listen the voice. It seem some big problem in microphone.
Dont know how come Samsung released this phone with such basic bug.",5

The pros: good battery life performance, excellent camera, and user friendly experience. Must buy if you are willing to shell out Rs 45k. I have to add that the camera is better than one plus 6",5

1932,Flipkart Customer,Awesome,good fone,5
1933,Sidharth Sreekumar,Nice product,"Bought during Big Billion Day sale for 29990. Overall a good flagship to own.

The main attraction point for me was the screen and the looks. Both of them did not disappoint as expected. The sAMOLED QHD screen is just perfect.

Performance is good. India gets the Exynos variant which is better optimized than the Snapdragon in Samsung phones. The 3000mAH is not the best in terms of battery. But the Exynos does a good job optimizing. The chip is nicely optimized for top end games like PUBG and Fortnite. Its so well optimized that, Facebook drains the battery more than the fore mentioned games.

The camera is a single rear lens which is not the norm in 2018. But it does the job well. Well detailed from a single sight but largely loses the detailing when zoomed. No portait mode. Video recording is good. Gets OIS. Front camera is average. On par with front camera of mid range phones in 2018.

The speaker on the phone is extremely poor. Both in terms of sound quality as well as loudness. Almost all mid range phones nowadays have much better speaker than this. Theyve tried to make up by including an AKG tuned in ear which tbh sounds pretty average. Samsung experience has a learning curve coming from stock android but will get accustomed soon enough.",4

2007,Sajad Meer,Value-for-money,"Bought it in BBDs . I paid 25.5 K for this awesome phone. Price has now been lowered to under 35K which means i saved 7K. Phone is good and performance is satisfactory at this price tag. There are more pros than cons. I think what buyers look for more is the cons about a product. I mention them as:- 1. Battery backup is less. For a heavy user it wont last more than 5 hours of continuous use. But battery optimization by samsung is good. 2. Phone is slippery without cover. 3. Position and size of F.P reader is not ergemonic could have been better. 4 The dust and finger proof claims for this phone are not genuine. 5. The worst con is about the fact that dust gets easily and swiftly into the rim between the body of the phone and the display . This is very much visible at the first glance. Its hard to keep the dust away from the phone rim around the display. 6. Outdated software, needs improvements. Hope that the phone gets updates for atleast a year. Final verdict: At this price its a lottery but if u r a heavy user , u may need to keep a power bank in your back pack to suffice the battery weakness. Thanks.",4
2008,RAVI KUMAR,Nice product,Good for money,4
2009,Manu Manoharan,Heating issue,"Pros :-
* Compact and stunning looks
* Awesome display and smooth touch.
* Great voice clarity while making calls.

Cons :-
* Getting heated, while using internet over 4G.
* While charging you can use it as an alternate to iron box.
* If mobile data is turned on, even without surfing, you can feel the warmth.
* Called customer care and reset the phone as they instructed, but still the issue persist. Even went to the service center - the stupid guys again reset the software and gave it back.
* Fingerprint sensor is slow and I feel bit uncomfortable with its placement .

Overall, even for 27.5K, this is not worth buying, due to the overheating. I think it would have been better spend money for some Chinese phones.",1
2010,Vivek Singh,Very Good,"I would love to give S8 a 5 if it just tries to give it's mobile the most versatile camera. The contrast colour in the main camera and the softness of the selfie camera is becoming unattractive after you see better images from pixel cameras or the pixel ported cameras.
The design and looks of this device is unparalleled and so is the screen The phone is snappy as anything and the battery can make it through the end of the day if you don't over use the phone.
A 5.8 inch device could never feel so small, but Samsung can make it.
An awesome piece of hardware and a good software.",4

2197,Prasanth Shanmugam,Good quality product,"Lemme give the overview of the mobile without deep diving much into specifications.

This mobile has an awesome display but lags in the battery and speaker department. If are rough user who holds the mobile in the hand all the time with the data on 4G, then this mobile is definitely not for you. I could say that this mobile has THE BEST DISPLAY ever. On viewing the screen size, this mobile has lesser width when compared to other mobiles. This makes the phone to feel handy. The screen is not a normal type so if you get this you have to spend a comparatively higher amount for safeguarding this screen with a temper guard. But it is not suggested to have a temper glass since it would tear down within a week or month. Go for 360case if protection is a great concern.


If the battery could been better, I would have given 5stars.",4
2198,Sunny Tinkhede,Really Nice,Device has beautiful....camera are excellent whether in condition of low light or not...4gb of RAM and 64gb of internal storage are enough....gives hybrid sim slot..Samsung gives excellent features in s series smart phone...so in 29990 it has best deal..,4

2225,Krunal Surti,Highly recommended,"Its a great device except battery is little bit on lower side, but in case of moderate use it won't hurt a lot.otherwise device has no cons. Very good device in terms of build & quality. very easy to handle thanks to Samsung's weird aspect ratio in display which helps to keep device thin despite of 5.8'' screen. edges on both sides also adds to its beauty.
Samsung nailed it as far as design of the phone. i can say its a best looking phone presently in the market. bought it during the Big Billion Days and i guess it was the best price for buying this device.
Specs are already mentioned on the site, so will not mention it again. I would say Exynos 8895 is not the most powerful chipset in market presently but it gets the Job done very well for most of the tasks. If you are a gamer and looking for a powerful gaming device then you should look for oneplus6. but if you are moderate user and would love to use features like Samsung pay and other Samsung features, then you can definitely consider this device.",5

2323,Rishabh Kumar,Nice product,"I bought this marvellous beauty at 30k on the big billion day. Many people adviced not to buy this phone when u can get one plus 6 at the same price. But frankly saying samsung flagships are one of its kind. And I knew this will be the bestest purchase I could ever make. The phone is freaking amazing and I just fell in love with this edge infinity design. It's a one year old device but frankly speaking, still its way ahead than its competitors .We shouldn't talk about Apple's iPhones, the old ones can't stand a comparison also, even the new ones are not as worthy of its price. If Apple can't how a one plus phone can, which was created with a intention of midrange flagship can stand a phone which may be a year old but was intended for a flagship phone. If you lost the chance to buy at 30k. the phone is still worth at 45k. Believe me!...and the last thing its alternative may have a good chipset a bit better performance but instead of those they have nothing to match this device. It's display , camera , its looks are just bestest money can buy",4

2380,Ayush,Worth every penny,"Best Phone still in 2018!
Pros-
- The best Super Amoled OLED display to get vivid colours out of screen.

- The best camera till yet compared to other phones at same budget(can also record super slo-mo videos after update 480fps).

- Best in performance wise and blazing fast and can install heavy apps in few seconds.

- Battery is good for me I can use for whole day with average usage.

- The best design u can get in the market(curved edges make the phone eye catching).

Cons-
Only one issue found till yet: The video gets shaky or hangs only while playing HDR videos on YouTube (Hope the issue may be resolved after updates).

2683,Flipkart Customer,Terrific purchase,Lovin' it!,5
2684,Anand BS,Pretty good,"Product is good. No issues as of now.

I would like to escalate regarding the Blue Dart services which is really not up to the mark and they do not have professional ethics in doing Business. My order was shipped at 2.45 pm on 11th October and I was not able to track the order until roughly around 4.30 pm on 12th October (as per Blue Dart website the maximum time they take to reflect order status is 24 hours, so definitely Job not done). They sent message on same day saying order will be delivered on 15th October, i had no issues.
The only problem is they delivered on the very next day, without any SMS or without any phone call, I had given office address and they just delivered to the reception, I got to know they have delivered only after Flipkart sent notification (not even a single notification, SMS from Blue Dart - not appreciated).

1) Why do they deliver costly items to a person who is not buyer without proper approval from actual buyer
2) Don't they have business Etiquette of sending SMS/making call before delivery or after delivery especially when the product is delivered to a different person?
3) Was not able to track the status for more than 24 hours, I can ignore considering they had several orders to delivery, but its their Job, they are into logistics (had it been Ekart, agreeable since they have lot of orders and they are not into Logistics)

There is one more order of mine, where the Blue Dart sent SMS today at 22.16 saying product will be attempted for delivery (Dont you have common sense people will be sleeping at time time or they will not be available to pick?). But 30 minutes later they sent SMS saying deliver was not successful because of address related issues (Come on, don't tell me this, you did not have issues to deliver two of my other products to the same building and you had issues on this?_

I have called Flipkart and escalated regarding the services provided by Blue Dart. Also told them that E-kart is great and people like Flipkart delivery since it is taken care by Ekart most of the times, but if they keep using Blue Dart, it might impact their ratings.

Infinity display is a bliss to use. Overall okay for the price.

2793,Subhradip Sil,Worth every penny,"HONEST REVIEW: Always wished to own a true flagship phone from SAMSUNG. Couldn't afford one till date. Finally owned it thanks to Flipkart BBD. Having the Galaxy S8 first time in hand feels like a super gorgeous piece you can't take your eyes off. It's perfect from every sense. Be it Looks, Camera, display, sound. It's the best looking device out there at this price point. Battery life which many people complain about should understand that it's a compact device(155 gm) with so many features and qHD super AMOLED. It's understandable. Still by few little tweaks you can still get a full day running with this beast. I don't have any complaints whatsoever till now. Hope my review was helpful to some extent for you to decide whether to choose this device or not. Will come up with a detailed review after using it for few days. Thanks.",5

Despite oneplus 6 is better in value proposition, nothing beats looks of Samsung curved display and it standsout . performance good enough for 3 years. samsung also promised less battery decay even after 1 year of heavy battery cycles. wireless charging is handy and elevated my table look in office . 4GB is enough for everday multitasking unless you are in to heavy video conversions and always want to keep 20 apps running. Good camera, pics are sharp and natural. one can enjoy portrait mode by installing ported Pixel camera app which is just as good like pixel phone. s8 can be managed with one handed and believe me, Burgundy red is very appealing and juicy colour. Go for oneplus 6 if you are speed user and heavy multitasker, otherwise s8 is more a practical choice.",5

3469,Santosh Rai,Offers changed after purchasing the phone,On pre booking there was offer of wireless charges now changed to 8 customers only. This is totally unfair policy of flipkart.,1

3476,Flipkart Customer,Worst experience ever!,"Fake claims by flipkart . I've followed all the steps to get my free wireless charger coupon . I received my phone on 2nd may ever since i was contacting Flipkart about this issue. All they do is raise an issue which would automatically be resolved without actually being resolved or they try to push this on Samsung and tell me to contact them . I could've got the same deal with ""real"" wireless charger coupon from my local store",1
3477,Bharat Kumar,Don't waste your money,Phone is good but Samsung will remain Samsung.. I am getting free coupon code for a back cover which is not valid and their customer service is so pathetic that they hung up everytime they hear my query.,1
3478,S Gupta,Botched Up Wireless Charger Offer,"The phone is pretty good but that Free Charger Offer appears to be questionable.
A very tedious process and in my case even after doing all the steps still not able to see the mentioned promotion on the Samsung Pay App.
Flipkart sort this out please.

Edit: Some people are suggesting a procedure through the My Galaxy App, that procedure is for phones bought through Samsung's distribution channels, the procedure for Flipkart is completely different (the Samsung Pay one). It's not like Flipkart is just free from all this, it's them who have mailed the whole different Samsung Pay procedure and not Samsung. Thus Flipkart themselves only need to sort this out with Samsung.",5
3479,sahin sultan,"fake seller, fake website, very bad customer experience","don't believe trucomretail they sold duplicate samsung galaxy s8, if anyone want their money spoil then buy from here , otherwise go for samsung official website where same offer you will get, bad customer service.",1

Flipkart is cheating by offering Wireless charger free... No way one can get the wireless charger",5
3492,Karan Shroff,Best in the market!,Phone is excellent. However the free wireless charger offer is not correct. Followed all the steps in the T & C and had prebooked before the offer period expired. Still received coupon code for back cover and not for free wireless charger. Called Samsung customer care but was informed to take up issue with Flipkart.,5
3493,Sumit anand,Unsatisfactory,I had received the phone with defective front camera. Till Date despite follow ups no replacement done. Shameful. Flipkart needs lot of improvement in customer focus.,1
3494,Shivraam I,Galaxy S8 Overheating ! - Worst Flipkart service,"I'm the iphone iOS user for long , with the design I had lot of hope with samsung to push mylself to buy Galaxy S8 ;
Using the mobile for 3 days now & after 16 mins on voice call I cannot keep over ear to continue because of over heating device. Even after 25 mins voice call I cannot hold on hand with red hot.

Pls be cautious before order the device; I'm now clueless & greatly reyling flipkart for replacement.

Still likes the great eligant design , display quality & good battery life.

- Shiv

flipkart appoints technical evaluation, where they did for sack of assessment & person realising the heat on plam but simply relying on CPU-Z app tempature even no physical temperture measuting device.

Last time Return request cancelled by default & after follow up call Sr. leader spoke to me saying that was a system issue.

Now again return request cancelled ! Guys its exp online ecommerce not doing fair. Now they deleted my negative comments!.",1
